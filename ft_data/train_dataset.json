Night is like paper soaked in oil and turned into a translucent body; It was embraced by the sun, and it could not be separated. Perhaps it was intoxicated by the sun, so the night after the sunset glow faded with Tuohong. When Hong Xiao was drunk, the sleeper in the cabin also woke up in a greasy sweat, took a shower and rushed to the deck to blow the sea breeze, another day began. This is the end of July, which is the hottest time of the year, and it is the third day of China's old calendar. In China, it was hotter than usual, and afterwards, everyone said it was a sign of war, because this was the year of the Republic of China (1937).\r\nThe French mail ship Vicomte de Bragelonne is heading for China. At eight o'clock in the morning, the washed third-class deck was wet, but it was full of people, including French, German Jews in exile, Indians, Annan people, not to mention China people. The sea breeze was already hot and dry, and the fat man's body was blown dry by the wind, covered with a layer of sweaty salt frost, as if he had just bathed in the Dead Sea in Palestine. After all, it is early in the morning, and people's interest has not been withered by the sun, and they are lazy and eager to talk and do things. Those newly sent French policemen to Annan or the Chinese Concession are flirting with the young coquettish Jewish woman. Bismarck once said that the characteristics of French ambassadors are that they can't speak a foreign language; These policemen don't know German, but they express their feelings, which makes Jewish women giggle, much better than their diplomats. This woman's beautiful husband enjoys watching, because he has been exposed to cigarettes, beer and lemonade for several days. The Red Sea has passed, and we are not afraid of the fire caused by heat, so after a while, apart from scattered peels, pieces of paper and bottle stoppers on the deck, cigarette butts will be everywhere again. The French people are famous for their clear thoughts and clean articles, but everything they do is chaotic, dirty and noisy, but look at the mess on this ship. This ship, relying on the ingenuity of people, is full of people's troubles and hopes, and goes along with excitement, returning a small square of water polluted by popularity to the heartless, endless and boundless sea every minute.\r\nAs usual, a group of China students return home every summer. There are also a dozen people on this ship. Most of them are young people whose jobs have not yet settled. When they return to China at the beginning of the summer vacation, they can take things easy. Those students who are not worried about nothing will not be willing to leave for home until autumn is cool. Some of these people on the boat studied in France, others in Britain, Germany and Belgium, and went to Paris to gain nightlife experience, so they also took a French boat. They met at the end of the world, and as soon as they met, they talked about the motherland that was invaded by foreign countries and civil strife, and they couldn't wait to go back to serve it at once. The boat went so slowly that everyone was homesick and worried that there was no place to put it. I don't know where two sets of mahjong tiles suddenly came. Mahjong is of course a national skill, and it is said that it is popular in the United States; Playing cards not only has the flavor of hometown, but also suits the world trend. Wonderful, the number of people can make up more than two tables, so apart from eating and sleeping, they gamble all day. Just after breakfast, the dining room below was busy playing the first round of cards, and only two China women and a small child were visible on the deck-at least the shipping company didn't treat him as a person and didn't ask his parents to buy tickets for him. The woman with sunglasses and a novel on her body is very elegant in clothes. The skin is white among orientals, but it's a pity that this white color is not fresh and dry. She took off her black glasses and had fine eyes, but her lips were too thin and lipstick was not rich enough. If she gets up from the deck chair, she will meet with a thin figure. Maybe the outline lines are too hard, like a square pen.",

The age seems to be 2056, but the age of the new women is like the age of the old women's wedding invitations, and it is impossible to see that it needs the so-called external evidence of the textual research scientists to determine the truth. The boy's mother is over thirty, wearing a semi-old black gauze cheongsam, full of fatigue and drowsiness, and naturally hanging her eyebrows upside down, which makes her feel more miserable. The child is less than two years old, with a flat nose, two slanted eyes and high eyebrows. They are so far away from each other that they are lovesick, just like the faces of China people in newspaper caricatures. He just learned to walk, and he kept running around; Mother put a belt on him, and he pulled it back after three or four steps. His mother was afraid of the heat, tired and upset by pulling her hand, and worried about her husband's winning or losing down there, so she kept scolding the child for being annoying. The child couldn't run much, so he changed his purpose and jumped on the woman who was reading. That woman usually has an air of narcissism and irrelevance-a common expression of a guest who is not perfunctory at a big party or an unmarried girl who is out of date at a wedding banquet-and now she shows disgust, which can't be covered by black glasses. The child's mother felt a little sorry and pulled the belt and said, \"You naughty child, go and make trouble with Miss Su! Come back quickly. -Miss Su, you study hard! Learning is so good, and you still read books all day. Mr.Sun often tells me that only female students like Miss Su can win face for China. They are beautiful and doctors. Where can such people be found? For example, we came to a foreign country for nothing, never read a word, stayed as a housewife all our lives, studied in China, and forgot to have a baby-scared! Damn it! I told you not to go. If you don't do good things, you must have soiled Miss Su's clothes. \"\r\nMiss Su has always looked down on this poor Mrs.Sun and disliked children the least, but after hearing these words, she was happy and smiled kindly: \"Let him come, I like children best.\" She took off her sunglasses, closed the book in front of her, held the child's wrist carefully to avoid rubbing it on her clothes, and asked him, \"Where's Dad?\" The child didn't answer, but opened his eyes wide and asked Miss Su, \"Bo! Wave! \" Blow spit and learn to blow bubbles from goldfish raised in the dining room. Miss Su let go in panic and took out a handkerchief to defend herself. Mother tugged at him, clamoring to hit him in the mouth, and sighed, \"Needless to say, his father is gambling down there! I don't understand why all men love gambling. You see, all of us in the same boat don't gamble in the dark. It's okay to win some money back. Like us, Mr.Sun has lost a lot of money and has to gamble. I hate it! \"\r\nAfter listening to the last few petty words, Miss Su could not help but feel contempt for Mrs.Sun and said coldly, \"Mr.Fang doesn't gamble.\"\r\nMrs.Sun's nostrils turned upward and she gasped, \"Mr.Fang! He also played cards when he got off the boat. Now he is too busy pursuing Miss Bao to spare time. People's lifelong events are much more important than gambling. I can't see the beauty of Miss Bao being dark and thick, which will lead Mr.Fang to change to a third class and suffer instead of being a second-class guest. I think they should get along very well.",

Maybe when the boat arrives in Hong Kong, they will get engaged. This is really' a thousand miles to meet'. \"\r\nWhen Miss Su heard this, her heart ached. She answered Mrs.Sun and comforted herself: \"That's impossible! Miss Bao has a fiance. She told me herself. The money for her study abroad was paid by her fiance. \"\r\nMrs.Sun said, \"Is it still so romantic to have a fiance? We are old-fashioned, and finally learn something new this time. Miss Su, let me tell you a joke. Mr.Fang and you are old classmates in China. Does he always talk casually? Yesterday, Mr.Sun told him that he was unlucky in gambling, and he was still laughing. He said that during his many years in France, Mr.Sun had no idea of the French superstition: his wife was unfaithful, he stole someone, his husband became a turtle, he won the lottery and he won the gambling. So, he said, men should console themselves by losing in gambling. Mr.Sun told me that I blamed him for not questioning Fang at that time. What did this mean? Now it seems that Miss Bao's fiance will definitely win the first prize in the aviation lottery. If she becomes Mrs.Fang, Mr.Fang will be very lucky in gambling. \" The malice of honest people, like gravel in rice or unclean thorns in boned fish fillets, will give people an unexpected pain.\r\nMiss Su said, \"Miss Bao doesn't behave like a schoolgirl, and it's shameful to dress up-\"\r\nThe child suddenly reached out his hands behind their chairs and laughed loudly. When they looked back, it was Miss Bao who came here with a piece of candy in her hand, teasing the child from a distance. She only wears a crimson tube top, sea blue shorts with meat on them, and her red nails are exposed in the blank leather shoes. In tropical hot weather, perhaps this is the most reasonable makeup, and there are one or two foreign women on board dressed like this. But Miss Su thinks that Miss Bao's nakedness hurts China's national system. Those male students saw their hearts on fire and quarreled with each other, laughing and joking behind Miss Bao's back. Some people call her \"charcuterie\", because only the deli will publicly display the meat with many warm colors; Some people call her \"truth\" because it is said that \"truth is naked\". Miss Bao was not naked, so they revised it to \"partial truth\".\r\nMiss Bao came and greeted them and said, \"You're up early. I like to be lazy in bed on a hot day. I didn't even know Miss Su got up today. She slept like a log. \" Miss Bao wanted to say \"sleeping like a pig\", but on second thought, she wanted to say \"like a dead man\". At last, she thought that a dead man was not much better than a pig, so she borrowed that metaphor from English. She quickly explained, \"This boat is really like a cradle, and people just want to sleep because it is in a daze.\"\r\n\"So, you are the baby sleeping in the cradle. Look, how cute! \" Miss Su said.\r\nMiss Bao hit her and said, \"You! Su Dongpo's sister, talented woman! \" -\"Su Xiaomei\" is the nickname given to Miss Su by the male students in the same boat. The word \"Dongpo\" sounds like \"tombeau\" in French for Miss Bao's Nanyang accent.\r\nMiss Su shares the cabin with Miss Bao and sleeps in the lower berth, which is much more convenient than Miss Bao's, so she doesn't have to climb up and down every day.",

But these days, she dislikes Miss Bao, and feels that everything has hindered her: snoring too loudly, making her unable to sleep, turning over too hard, and the upper berth seems to be falling down. After giving Miss Bao a call, she said, \"Mrs.Sun, make a comment. Call her' little baby' and get beaten! Sleeping is a blessing. I know you love to sleep, so I never keep silent, lest I wake you. You told me you were afraid of getting fat, but you are so sleepy on the boat, I think you should put on a few pounds again. \"\r\nThe child clamored for candy and bit it when he got it. His mother called him Miss Xie Bao, but he ignored it. Mrs.Sun had to perfunctory with Miss Bao herself. Miss Su had seen that this sugar was cheap, and it was the cube sugar used for breakfast coffee on the ship. She despised Miss Bao's style and didn't want to tell her more. She opened the book again, but she caught sight of Miss Bao pulling two canvas chairs to a distant place and putting them there, calling her shameless and hating herself why she went to see her. At that time, Fang Hung-chien also came to the deck, walked in front of them, stopped for a few words of entertainment, and asked \"how's your little brother\". Mrs.Sun gave an indifferent reply. Miss Su said with a smile, \"Go quickly, aren't you afraid of people waiting?\" Fang Hung-chien blushed and smirked, and left Miss Su. Miss Su knew she couldn't keep him, but he did go, but she was disappointed. I didn't read a word in the book, but I heard Miss Bao talking and laughing, and she couldn't help reading it. Fang Hung-chien was smoking a cigarette, and Miss Bao reached out to him. He took out a cigarette case and gave her one. Miss Bao held it in her mouth, and his finger was on the lighter box to light it for her. Suddenly, her mouth greeted her, and she put the cigarette butt on his cigarette butt and sucked it. The cigarette lit, and Miss Bao proudly exhaled. Miss Su was so angry that she felt cold. She thought that these two people were shameless and kissed in public with cigarettes. I couldn't watch it any more. I stood up and said I wanted to go down. In fact, she knew that there was no place to go down there, someone was playing cards in the dining room, and the cabin was too stuffy. Mrs.Sun also wanted to go down and ask the man how much money he lost today, but she was afraid that the man would lose in a hurry. When she asked, she took it out on herself and quarreled for half a day when she went back to the cabin. So I didn't dare to get up. I just asked the children if they wanted to go down and pee.\r\nMiss Su was really wronged when she called Fang Hung-chien shameless. At that time, he was so embarrassed that everyone on the deck seemed to be paying attention to him. He blamed Miss Bao for being too capable and wished he could say a few words to her. Although he is now 27 years old and engaged, he has no love training. My father was a former Qing juren, and he was a great gentleman in a small county in the south of the Yangtze River. People in their county who live in big cities live in nine out of ten jobs: working while the iron is hot, working in grinding bean curd and carrying sedan chairs.",

Although he is now 27 years old and engaged, he has no love training. My father was a former Qing juren, and he was a great gentleman in a small county in the south of the Yangtze River. People in their county who live in big cities live in nine out of ten jobs: working while the iron is hot, working in grinding bean curd and carrying sedan chairs. Clay dolls are the most famous works of art in native products; When young people enter universities, they mainly study civil engineering. The iron is hard, the tofu is tasteless, the sedan chair has a small capacity, and it is earthy. This is their folk customs. Even those who get rich and become officials are not generous. In this county, a surnamed Zhou opened an iron shop in Shanghai to make a fortune, and organized a small bank with fellow villagers in the same industry, named \"Dianjinyinhang\", and became the manager himself. He remembered the idiom \"Returning home with clothes on\". One year, he took Tomb-Sweeping Day back to the county to visit the shrine and meet local people. Fang Hung-chien's father was a homesick man, and Manager Zhou had to visit him at home, so he became friends and climbed from friend to in-law. Hung-chien was still studying in high school, and he got engaged with his family. The fiancee didn't meet each other, only looked at a half-length photo and didn't care. Two years later, I went to Peking to enter the university, and I experienced the flavor of male and female students for the first time. See how jealous people are when they fall in love. I think of my fiancee who studied in high school for a year, so she doesn't go to school, practices housework at home, and when she marries to be a capable daughter-in-law, she can't help but hate her. I complained about my life and my father. I stayed for a few days and suddenly woke up. I bravely wrote home and asked to cancel the contract. His Chinese was instructed by Laozi, and he passed the second place in the middle school entrance examination, so this letter is elegant, and even those who don't care about it are wrong. What did the letter say: \"Recently, I have been sentimental, unhappy and sad, and my arms are full of autumn. Every time I look in the mirror, I feel cold and sharp, clearing up the phase of those who are not alive. I am afraid that I will not read it, and Ms. Zhou may delay it for life. I still hope that the adult's pituitary gland will be in love, and it will be a good thing to solve the bell. I can't bear to hate it in the end. \" He thinks that the wording of this letter is sad and hard-hearted. Who knew that my father would send a letter and berate me: \"I don't hesitate to spend a lot of money, so you are so busy studying that you have time to look in the mirror.\" If you are not a woman, why do you need a mirror? However, the children of Liyuan, as husbands, look at the mirror and look at the mirror, which is despised by the world. I don't want you to leave your knees and have been exposed to bad habits. What a pity! And parents are here, don't talk about old age, you are not good at thinking far away, scared by death, and you are unfilial, so you are extremely embarrassed! When you are a male and female classmate in your school, you will see the color and change your mind; You make excuses to grieve for autumn. I know that you are really in love with spring, and you can't escape from the old lady's experience. If you don't regret it, I will stop sending money, order you to drop out of school and go home, and marry your brother at the same time next year. Think carefully about my words and be careful! \" Fang Hung-chien was half scared, but he didn't expect the old man to be so smart.",

Think carefully about my words and be careful! \" Fang Hung-chien was half scared, but he didn't expect the old man to be so smart. Busy writing back for forgiveness and explanation, saying: the mirror belongs to my roommate, and he didn't buy it; Eating American cod liver oil pills and German vitamin tablets these days has improved my body and spirit, and my face is full. Unfortunately, the drug price is too expensive to give up money. As for the marriage festival, please hold it after graduation. On the one hand, it will hinder his studies, and on the other hand, he will not be able to support his family, which will add to his father's burden and make him uneasy. When his father received this letter, he proved that his majesty was thousands of miles away, and he was so proud that he happily remitted some money to his son to buy tonic medicine. From then on, Fang Hung-chien never dared to dream, and began to study Schopenhauer. He often wisely said to his classmates, \"How can there be love in the world? It is a reproductive impulse at all. \" In a blink of an eye, I have reached the fourth year of college, only waiting for graduation and marriage next year. One day, my father sent an express letter, which said, \"I have received a telegram from Ru Yuezhang, and I learned that Shuying was ill with typhoid fever, which was mistaken by western medicine. Therefore, she died at 4 pm on the 13th of this month, which is extremely regrettable. The door is just around the corner, and many good things are grinding, all of which are caused by your lack of happiness. \" After the letter, I added a few words: \"A blessing in disguise is a blessing in disguise. If we got married three years ago, our family would have spent a lot of money this time. However, if the marriage ends early, my sister-in-law may be able to escape the disaster and prolong her life. Before marriage, don't be too sad. But your father-in-law should send a letter of condolence. \" Hung-chien was happy to see that the prisoner was forgiven, but he also had a little pity for the short-lived girl. Since I enjoy the joy of freedom and want others to reduce my sorrow, I really sent a long letter of condolences to my husband who had not passed the door. When Manager Zhou received the letter, he felt that the child was polite, so he handed it to Director Wang in the bank for reply. When the director of the clerical department saw the original letter, he greatly complimented the uncle who had not passed the door for his good arts, literature and calligraphy, and his deep affection for the deceased. He wanted to see the nature very thick, so he must be a far-reaching tool. Manager Zhou listened happily and asked the director to write back, saying, \"Although my daughter has never gone through the door, Weng Xu's birthright has not changed, and she only has one daughter in her life. I wanted to have a good time. Now, I will add the money from the wedding ceremony and the interest earned from the Fang family's engagement for her daughter's business, totaling 20,000 yuan, equivalent to 1,300 pounds in foreign exchange, to pay Fang Hung-chien for studying abroad when he graduates next year.\" Fang Hung-chien never dreamed of such good luck and was very grateful to his dead fiancee. He is a useless man, unable to learn civil engineering. He switched from sociology to philosophy at university, and finally graduated from China Literature Department. It sounds funny that people who study Chinese go abroad for further study. In fact, only those who study China literature have to study abroad.",

He is a useless man, unable to learn civil engineering. He switched from sociology to philosophy at university, and finally graduated from China Literature Department. It sounds funny that people who study Chinese go abroad for further study. In fact, only those who study China literature have to study abroad. Because all other subjects like mathematics, physics, philosophy, psychology, economics, law and so on.It was instilled from abroad, and it has long been foreign; Only when the Chinese language is a local product and needs foreign signs can it maintain its position, just as the money exploited by China officials and businessmen in their own country needs to be exchanged for foreign exchange to maintain the original value of the national currency.\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien arrived in Europe, he neither paid for Dunhuang papers, nor visited Yongle Dadian, nor looked for documents of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, nor studied Mongolian, Tibetan or Sanskrit. Three universities have changed in four years, London, Paris and Berlin; Listening to a few courses casually, I have a wide range of interests and no experience, and my life is especially lazy. In the spring of the fourth year, he saw that there were only more than 400 pounds left in the bank and planned to return to China in the summer. Mr.Fang also wrote to ask him if he had obtained a doctorate and when he would return to the East. He wrote back and talked about it, lambasting the doctor's title as impractical. Mr.Fang is no big deal, but his son is too old to threaten his father's dignity any more; Then the letter said that he knew the title was useless and would never force his son, but Manager Zhou paid a lot of money and finally had to give him an account. A few days later, Fang Hung-chien received another letter from his father-in-law, saying, \"A good husband is a man of great learning and wealth, and he is famous in five continents. There is no need to boast about his doctor. However, your father's adult was a filial piety in the former Qing Dynasty, and it seems appropriate for a virtuous husband to promote foreign scholars, and he was a few grams of Shao Jiqiu, and he came from behind, and he was stupid and glorious. \" Fang Hung-chien was attacked from both sides before he realized the importance of studying abroad. This diploma seems to have the function of Adam and Eve's lower body leaf, which can cover up the shame and cover up the ugliness; A small piece of paper can cover up a person's emptiness, ignorance and stupidity. I don't have a diploma, as if I were naked in spirit and didn't have a package. However, to get a degree now, no matter whether you study by yourself or hire a gunman to do a thesis on your behalf, time and economy are not enough. It's the easiest to get a doctorate from the nearest University of Hamburg, but it will take six months. Simply lie to your family and say that you are a doctor. I am afraid that my father and father-in-law will be fooled. My father is a man in the imperial examination, depending on the \"newspaper\", and my husband is a businessman, depending on the deed. He can't think of any way to go home and say with a straight face that he didn't get his degree. One day, he went to see a German friend in the China book cataloging room of Berlin Library, and saw a lot of periodicals published in Shanghai in the early years of the Republic of China on the floor, including Oriental Magazine, Novel Monthly, Greater China and Women's Magazine. The letter hand turned over an advertisement in both Chinese and English, which was posted by the Correspondence Department of Clayton Law and Business College in new york, USA. It said that in view of the fact that China students are interested in studying abroad and have no chance, our school has set up a special correspondence class to give them a certificate equivalent to a bachelor's degree, a master's degree or a doctor's degree in the future, and the articles of association will be sent upon request.",

The correspondence office is located at the number of the street in new york. Fang Hung-chien's heart moved, thinking that after more than 20 years, I don't know if this school exists. Anyway, it won't cost much to write and ask. The man who advertised turned out to be a liar, because China people would not fall for it, and they would have died long ago. The apartment he lives in is now rented to an Irishman, with Irish irresponsibility, Irish quickness and Irish poverty. According to legend, Irish fortune is milk and ass; This is a tall and thin man of Shaw style, and the weight of those two properties has to be discounted. He got Hung-chien's letter in the mailbox at that time, thinking that the postman had sent it by mistake, but the address was obviously his own. Curious to open it, he thought for a long time and jumped for joy. I borrowed a typewriter from a tabloid reporter in the next room and wrote a reply, saying that since Mr.Wang is studying in a European university, his degree must be advanced, and there is no need to go through correspondence procedures. As long as he sends a 10,000-word paper with a US$ 500 attached, he will immediately send a doctorate in philosophy, and the letter can be sent to himself without writing the name of the school. Signed Patrick Mahoney, with four or five doctoral titles from the back. Fang Hung-chien read the stationery for ordinary use, and the name of the school was not engraved on it. The contents of the letter were obviously a scam, so he put it aside and ignored it. The Irish people were anxious, so they sent another letter, saying that if the price was too expensive, they could negotiate from a long-term perspective. I have always loved China, and those who run education are especially reluctant to make profits. Fang Hung-chien figured it out, thinking that the Irish were undoubtedly playing tricks, and they bought a fake diploma and went back to deceive people. Did they not become liars? But-remember, Fang Hung-chien went to the philosophy department-lying and cheating are sometimes not immoral. Plato's Republic says that soldiers should cajole the enemy, doctors should cajole the patients, and officials should cajole the people. As holy as Confucius, he pretended to be ill, which made Confucianism sad. Mencius even lied to Qi Xuanwang and pretended to be sick. Father and father-in-law want to be doctors. Do sons and sons-in-law have the nerve to disappoint them? Buy a diploma to coax them, so that they can spend money to donate an official, or British colonial businessmen can serve the imperial treasury for tens of thousands of pounds and change their knighthood, which is also what a dutiful son and son-in-law should do. Anyway, when I look for a job in the future, I will never open this degree on my resume. Just kill the price extremely low. If the Irish refuse, even if it blows, they will not be a liar. Then he wrote back and said, \"For an extra $100, send 30 dollars first, and then send the balance when you get the diploma.\": There are still more than 30 students from China here, and they are all willing to approach your school in this way. At first, the Irish didn't want to promise. Later, seeing Fang Hung-chien's firm tone, they found out that the American doctorate was really fashionable in China, and gradually believed that there were more than 30 China idiots in Europe who wanted to buy diplomas from him. He also found out that there are many peers who do this kind of business, such as Oriental University, East American University, Intercollegiate University, Truth University, etc.",

At first, the Irish didn't want to promise. Later, seeing Fang Hung-chien's firm tone, they found out that the American doctorate was really fashionable in China, and gradually believed that there were more than 30 China idiots in Europe who wanted to buy diplomas from him. He also found out that there are many peers who do this kind of business, such as Oriental University, East American University, Intercollegiate University, Truth University, etc. The cheap one can buy a master's degree for ten dollars, and the College of Divine Metaphysics gives away three kinds of doctoral diplomas at a low price.; These are all registered schools, and they can't compare with each other. So he made a deal with Hung-chien with the aim of selling at small profits. He received thirty dollars, printed forty or fifty blank diplomas, filled out one and sent it to Hung-chien, with a letter urging him to pay and informing other students to contact him. Hung-chien wrote back that after a detailed investigation, there was no such school in the United States, and the diploma was waste paper. I missed my first offense and didn't pursue it, hoping to repent and turn over a new leaf, and remit ten dollars to fill the capital for changing careers. Irish people were so angry that they kept cursing, got drunk, and looked forward to fighting with China people. This may be China's only victory since it entered into a diplomatic or business agreement.\r\nHung-chien first went to the photo studio, put on the uniform of a German university doctor and took a four-inch photo. My father and father-in-law sent one each, and the letter told me that I hated the name of \"doctor\" the most in my life, but this time I failed to avoid custom and was not good for others. I went back to France for a few weeks and bought a second-class ticket to return home. After boarding the boat in Marseille, he found that he was the only China person in the second class, so he was very lonely and bored. The third-class China students thought he was also a student and sat in the second class ostentatiously, which was a little hostile to him. He found out that there was an empty shop in the cabin of a third-class Annan, so he discussed with the ship's steward and voluntarily gave up the original cabin and moved down to sleep, and the meal was still second-class. Among the China people in the same boat, only Miss Su is an old acquaintance of China, who studied French literature in Lyon, wrote a paper on Eighteen Vernacular Poets in China, and was newly awarded a doctorate. When she was a college classmate, she didn't necessarily have this boy Fang Hung-chien in her eyes. At that time, Miss Su valued her love too much and refused to give it casually. Now, it's like making a good dress, reluctant to wear it, locked in a box, and suddenly found that the appearance and color of this dress are not fashionable in a year or two, and some feel sorry for themselves. Once upon a time, she was bent on studying abroad, thinking that those people who pursued themselves had no future, and it was a big deal to be college graduates. Now, as a female doctor, she feels lofty and lonely, and no one dares to climb up. She knows a little about Fang Hung-chien's family background. She doesn't hate others and seems to have enough money. She is quite interested in taking advantage of this voyage to give him a chance to get close. Miss Bao, who didn't watch out for her cabin, robbed her first. Miss Bao grew up in Macau and is said to have Portuguese blood in her body. The phrase \"Portuguese blood\" means that the Japanese claim to have a standard culture, or the author who privately adapted a foreign script declares that his revised version is \"copyrighted and not allowed to be translated\". Because there is China in Portuguese blood. According to Miss Bao's figure, her Portuguese mother may have indirectly transmitted Arab blood from Spain. Miss Bao has a slim waist, which is in line with the beauty condition praised by Arab poets in Arabian Nights: \"The waist is thin and the back is heavy, and the waist is sore when standing.\"",

Miss Bao has a slim waist, which is in line with the beauty condition praised by Arab poets in Arabian Nights: \"The waist is thin and the back is heavy, and the waist is sore when standing.\" Under the long eyelashes, there are a pair of sleepy, smiling and dreamy eyes, and the perfect upper lip seems to be bulging with a lover. Her fiance, Dr. Li, didn't know how to take good care of herself and paid her to go to London to study obstetrics alone. There is a Portuguese proverb that says, \"If you are lucky, your first child will be a woman.\" Because when a girl grows up, she can do odd jobs and take care of her younger brothers and sisters. Before she is married, her parents save the wages of the next female servant. Miss Bao has been used to being called by her parents since she was a child. She has a bright mind and understands that she should find opportunities and happiness by herself. So she would rather be engaged to someone twelve years older than herself and have the opportunity to go abroad. British people are used to seeing white skin, seeing her dark but not black color and fat and spicy gravity, thinking that this is an authentic oriental beauty. She was confident that she could seduce people, so she was seduced very quickly and easily. Fortunately, she is a medical student, so she doesn't take anything seriously and nothing is wrong. After two years in England, she went back to get married and listed with her husband. After boarding the boat, China students found out that she was a \"British citizen\" passport issued by the Hong Kong government, which was not China nationality, so they didn't go to get close to her. She doesn't speak French, and she doesn't bother to talk to the Guangdong waiter in the third class. She is very bored. She thinks that Fang Hung-chien is a second-class passenger, and he is a passable person, so he can be regarded as a recreational companion during the trip. Miss Su's ideal self is \"as gorgeous as peaches and plums, as cold as ice\", which makes Fang Hung-chien humbly admire and then prostrate himself in courtship. Who knows that although the climate is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit every day, this sweet and cold ice cream style will not work. Miss Bao hooked Fang Hung-chien with one easy sentence. Hung-chien moved to the third-class tomorrow and went for a walk on the deck. When he happened to meet Miss Bao with her back against the railing, she greeted him and started talking. After a few words, Miss Bao said with a smile, \"Mr.Fang, you remind me of my fianc\u00e9. You look just like him!\" Hearing this, Fang Hung-chien was both shy and proud. A lovely woman says that you are like her fiance, which means that if she is not engaged, you are entitled to her love. The mean person may explain this way. She has another fiance, and you can enjoy her fiance's rights without fulfilling the obligation to marry her. Anyway, since then, their friendship has grown like a tropical plant. Other male students in China joked with Fang Hung-chien and forced him to treat everyone to iced coffee and beer.\r\nAt that time, although Fang Hung-chien blamed Miss Bao for her bad behavior, she was also excited. Looking back, I saw two empty chairs of Miss Su and Mrs Sun. Fortunately, the matter of cigarettes just disappeared in their eyes. That night, there was a sea breeze and the ship was a little bumpy. After ten o'clock, there were only three or five pairs of men and women on the deck, all hiding in the dark shadows where the lights could not shine. Fang Hung-chien and Miss Bao walked side by side without talking. A big wave shook the hull badly, and Miss Bao could not stand steadily.

Fang hung-chien hooked her waist and stayed by the railing, kissing her greedily. Miss Bao's lips suggested that the body followed, and this hasty and rude kiss gradually stabilized and grew properly and densely. Miss Bao deftly pushed off Fang Hung-chien's arm, took a deep breath in her mouth and said, \"I'm suffocated by you! I have a cold and I can't breathe in my nose-it's too cheap for you, and you haven't asked me to love you! \"\r\n\"I beg you now, ok?\" It seems that all men who have never been in love, Fang Hung-chien regards the word \"love\" too noble and serious and refuses to apply it to women casually; He only felt that he wanted Miss Bao and didn't love her, so he was so evasive.\r\n\"Anyway, there is nothing to say, and I can't escape those old words.\"\r\n\"When you put your mouth together, I'll say it to your mouth, and it will always get into your heart, so as not to take a long way and turn a corner and go in through your ear.\"\r\n\"I'm not fooled by you! Have something to say in a polite way. That's enough for today. If you don't mess around with me, I'll tomorrow ... \"Fang Hung-chien ignored it. And put his hand around her waist. Suddenly, when the boat came to one side, he didn't hold the railing, and almost took Miss Lai Bao to fall. At the same time, the other women in the shadow screamed, \"Ouch!\" Miss Bao took advantage of the situation to get away and said, \"I feel cold, so I'll go down first. See you tomorrow. \" Leaving Fang Hung-chien on the deck. Dark clouds rose early in the sky, and a few stars leaked out. The wind and waves were like the sound of gluttony, and the sea in Wang Yang during the day was completely digested in a wider faint night. Against this background, the agitation of a person's body and mind is also reduced to nothing, but the hope of tomorrow in his heart has not yet fallen into the gloom, and in the dark depths of the vast expanse, it shines like a firefly.\r\nFrom that day on, Fang Hung-chien often ate third-class meals. Miss Su's attitude towards him is obviously cold. He asked Miss Bao privately why Miss Su had been so indifferent recently. Miss Bao laughed at him as a fool and said, \"I can guess why, but I won't tell you so as not to add to your arrogance.\" Fang Hung-chien said that she was nervous, but then she felt more embarrassed when she met Miss Su. The ship passed Ceylon and Singapore, and arrived in Saigon in a few days. This is the first colony that French ships can be proud of along the way. The Frenchman on the boat saw his home like a dog, and his momentum was long, and his actions and voices were louder. The ship will dock in the afternoon and stay there for two nights. Miss Su has relatives who work in the China Consulate here. They sent a car to the dock to pick her up for dinner. In everyone's envious eyes, she got off the boat first. The rest of the students decided to have dinner in China restaurant. Fang Hung-chien wanted to go out to dinner with Miss Bao, but he was embarrassed to say it in front of everyone, so he had to go with them. After dinner, Mr.and Mrs.Sun Shi took the children back to the boat first. I sat in the cafe for a while, and Miss Bao suggested going to the ballroom.

Although Fang Hung-chien spent money to learn two dancing lessons in France, his skills were not at home. I danced with Miss Bao once, so I had to sit and watch her dance with others. At twelve o'clock, everyone went back to the boat to sleep. When I got off at the dock, Fang Hung-chien and Miss Bao fell behind. Miss Bao said, \"Miss Su won't come back today.\"\r\n\"My fellow Annan also went ashore, and I heard that his berth was sold to a China businessman who went to Hong Kong from Saigon.\"\r\n\"We both slept alone today,\" Miss Bao seemed to say casually.\r\nFang Hung-chien's heart flashed like a flash of lightning, but he was too scared to stare, and his whole body's blood rose to his face. He was about to speak when the companion in front turned around and shouted, \"Why can't you talk all the time! Walking slowly is afraid that we will hear, isn't it? \" Without saying anything, they caught the boat and everyone said \"good night\" and dispersed. Fang Hung-chien took a bath, returned to the cabin, lay down and sat up again, giving up the thought that he had already had, as if it were as painful as a woman who was pregnant and had to have an abortion. Perhaps Miss Bao's remark had no intention, so she went there and asked for it. The deck is loading, and there are two patrolling waiters in the corridor to prevent idle people from mixing down, so it is hard to protect them from seeing it. I can't make up my mind and won't give up. Suddenly, I heard brisk footsteps, like coming from Miss Bao's cabin. Hung-chien's heart jumped up, and he was stifled by the footsteps, as if he were stepping on his heart step by step. The footsteps stopped halfway, and his heart stopped moving. For a while, his heart was overwhelmed, but fortunately, the footsteps continued to accelerate. Hung-chien was no longer confused, and his heart couldn't hold back. He was so happy that he wanted to shout. He jumped out of the bunk and opened the door curtain without putting on his slippers. First, he smelled the scent of Miss Bao's usual talcum powder.\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien wakes up tomorrow morning, the sun is full of windows, and it's past nine o'clock on the watch. He thought that the night's sleep was so sweet that he didn't have a dream. No wonder he called it \"black sweet country\". He also thought that Miss Bao had dark skin and a sweet smile. When he met later, he could call her \"black sweet\", and he also associated it with black and sweet chocolate candy. Unfortunately, the chocolate candy made in France was not good and the weather was hot, so he shouldn't eat it, otherwise he would buy her a box. While he was lazy in bed thinking, Miss Bao bounced outside the bulkhead and called him a \"slacker\", telling him to get up quickly and go ashore to play with him. After Fang Hung-chien finished washing and dressing, she waited outside Miss Bao's cabin for a long time before she got dressed. The dining room was opened early, and two people were ordered for breakfast. The waiter who served them at this table was Liu, who was in charge of Fang Hung-chien's cabin. When they finished eating, they wanted to leave. Liu didn't tidy up the things on the table first. She smiled at them and held out her hand. In her hand, three women with hair between them said sloppily in Cantonese, \"Mr.Fang, I just made your bed.\"\r\nMiss Bao blushed and her eyes seemed to burst. Fang Hung-chien was so anxious that he scolded himself for being confused that he didn't behave himself when he got up. At the same time, he took out 300 francs and said to Ah Liu, \"Here!",

Give it back to me. \" Liu thanked him and said that he was the most reliable person and would never talk nonsense. Miss Bao looked away and just didn't know. Out of the dining room, Fang Hung-chien returned the hairpin to Miss Bao with an apology. Miss Bao threw it angrily on the ground and said, \"Who wants this thing! After that guy's dirty hands! \"\r\nThis ruined their luck all day, and everything was awkward. They took the rickshaw to the wrong place, paid the wrong money for things, and neither of them had good luck. Fang Hung-chien also thought of having lunch at the China restaurant last night. Miss Bao insisted on western food, saying that she didn't want to meet acquaintances on the same boat. I found a western restaurant with a decent appearance. Who knows that from cold cuts to coffee, nothing is delicious: the soup served is cold, but the ice cream is hot; Fish, like marines, have landed for several days; Meat is like a submarine soldier, lying in the water for a long time; Except vinegar, bread, butter and red wine are all sour. The two of them ate their stomachs, and the conversation was not speculative. Fang Hung-chien wanted to please Miss Bobao, so he told her the intimate names of \"Black Sweet\" and \"Miss Chocolate\". Miss Bao said abruptly, \"Am I that black?\" Fang Hung-chien stubbornly argued, \"I love your color. I saw a famous beauty dancing in Spain this year. Her skin was only a little lighter than foreign smoked ham. \"\r\nMiss Bao's answer was illogical: \"Maybe you like the white belly of Miss Su's dead fish. You yourself are a little black charcoal sweeping the chimney, and you don't look in the mirror! \" Said with a triumphant smile.\r\nFang Hung-chien sprayed Miss Bao with black, so it's hard to talk about it. The waiter served the chicken, and there was a piece of meat in the dish that looked like the iron rooster's alms on the wind needle in the chapel. Miss Bao couldn't cut it hard, so she put down her knife and fork and said, \"I have no teeth to bite this thing! This restaurant is terrible. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien made persistent efforts in fighting cocks, gritting his teeth and saying, \"You don't listen to me, you want to eat western food.\"\r\n\"I want to eat western food, I didn't ask you to go to this unlucky restaurant! Do something wrong, weirdo afterwards, your men's temper is all like this! \" Miss Bao said it as if every man's character in the world had been tested by her.\r\nAfter a while, somehow, Miss Bao talked about her fiance, Dr. Li, and said that he was also a devout Christian. Fang Hung-chien was full of grievances. When he heard this, he was evil in his heart. His desire to believe in religion didn't affect Miss Bao's behavior at all, so he had to borrow Dr. Li's irony and said, \"How can a Christian be a doctor?\"\r\nMiss Bao didn't understand this and looked at him with her eyes open.\r\nHung-chien added milk to the coffee with burnt bean skin in front of Miss Bao, saying, \"One of the Ten Commandments of Christianity is' Don't kill people', but what should doctors do besides killing people professionally?\"\r\nMiss Bao said angrily without humor, \"Nonsense! Doctors save lives. \"\r\nSeeing her lovely anger, Hung-chien deliberately teased her and said, \"You can't believe in religion even if you save lives.",

Medicine needs people to live and save people's bodies; Religion saves people's souls, and people are not afraid of death. So patients are afraid of death, so they have to ask a doctor to take medicine; Medicine is ineffective, and if you can't escape death, you will find a priest and a priest to die. Studying medicine and being religious at the same time means saying: If I can't teach the patient to live well, at least I can teach him to die well. Anyway, he can't be wrong in asking me. It's like a pharmacy shopkeeper taking a coffin shop, which is too cheap! \"\r\nMiss Bao was really angry. \"Look, you'll never get sick. Don't consult a doctor. You only rely on a glib mouth, which is nonsense. I am also studying medicine. Why do you harm people out of thin air? \"\r\nFang Hung-chien apologized in panic, and Miss Bao complained that she had a headache and wanted to go back to the boat to rest. Hung-chien was careful along the way, but Miss Bao was just listless. After seeing her back to the cabin, Hung-chien also slept for two hours. Together, we went to miss Bao's cabin to call her name and ask her if she was ready. Unexpectedly, when the curtain opened, Miss Su came out and said that Miss Bao was ill. She vomited twice and just fell asleep. Ashamed and embarrassed, Hung-chien made a perfunctory remark and hurried away. At dinner, when everyone saw that Miss Bao was not on the table, they teased Fang Hung-chien about important people. Hung-chien said vaguely, \"She's tired and she's not feeling well.\" Miss Su looked sad and said, \"She came back from eating with Mr.Fang, and her stomach hurt. At this time, she can't eat anything. I'm just worried that she won't get dysentery! \" Those heartless male students laughed, noisily way:\r\n\"Who taught her to carry us to eat with Xiao Fang?\"\r\n\"Small party is a shame! Why don't you pick a clean restaurant when you invite your girlfriend to dinner? \"\r\n\"Eating out can't be wrong. Maybe Miss Bao is too happy to be digested by greed. Xiao Fang, right? \"\r\n\"Small square, you didn't get sick? Oh, I see! Miss Bao is delicious. You don't have to eat when you are full. \"\r\n\"I'm afraid the meal is not beautiful, but-\"The man was going to say \"cooked meat\", but suddenly he wanted to be Miss Su. This remark was indecent, and it might be passed on to Miss Bao, so he picked a piece of bread and chewed it in his mouth.\r\nFang Hung-chien didn't have enough for lunch. At this time, he couldn't stand everyone's jokes and ran away before the food was served. The others laughed even more. He stood up and turned around, and saw Liu standing behind him, winking at himself tacitly.\r\nMiss Bao didn't get up until she slept for more than a day. Although she was playing with Fang Hung-chien, she didn't get out of shape as before.

The afternoon before arriving in Hong Kong, everyone exchanged their correspondence addresses after returning home, and said goodbye to each other several times, as if this friendship in the same boat would never be forgotten. Hung-chien was about to go up to the deck to look for Miss Bao when Liu called \"Mr.Fang\" furtively. Ever since he gave him 300 francs that day, Hung-chien was flustered when he saw this guy and asked him what he wanted with a straight face. Liu said that there was no guest in one of the rooms he was in charge of, and asked Hung-chien if he wanted it tonight. He only asked for 600 francs. Hung-chien waved and said, \"What do I need it for?\" Three feet and two steps up the stairs, only to hear Liu sneer at behind his back. He suddenly realized Liu's intention and his face turned hot with shame. Go up and speak hesitatingly and tell Miss Bao about it, and call Liu an asshole. She snorted and said nothing else. When others come, it is inconvenient to talk about it. At dinner, Mr.Sun said, \"Today is our parting commemoration. We have to play all night. Liu has an empty cabin, and I've booked 200 francs. \"\r\nMiss Bao gave Hung-chien a contemptuous look, and immediately looked at the plate and drank the soup.\r\nMrs.Sun fed the spoon to the child and said timidly, \"Aren't you afraid of getting tired?\"\r\nMr.Sun said, \"Find a hotel tomorrow and sleep in it for a few days and nights. The machinery on board is very noisy, so I can't sleep well.\"\r\nFang Hung-chien gave Miss Bao a look of pride like a deflated rubber tire. After dinner, Miss Bao and Miss Su were very affectionate and hooked hands. He had no ambition, so he followed the deck to see them talking and laughing, and he wouldn't allow himself to plug in, so he couldn't squeeze in the words when they were squashed; Consciously boring and humiliated, like a beggar chasing behind a rickshaw, he ran a lot of roads and didn't get a penny, but he was unwilling to stop. Miss Bao looked at her watch and said, \"I'm going to sleep. The boat will dock before dawn tomorrow, and you can't sleep well in the morning. I don't go to bed early today, and when I go ashore tomorrow, I will be depressed and have no spirit. It's ugly. \" Miss Su said, \"You love beauty so much, and you are afraid that Mr.Li will not love you again! It's even more painful to be a bit embarrassed! \"\r\nMiss Bao said, \"Is that your experience? Well, I'll be home tomorrow! I'm so excited that I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep well. Miss Su, let's go down and talk comfortably in the cabin. \"\r\nNodding to Hung-chien, the two of them went down. Hung-chien was so angry that his heart was burning, as if he would burn the end of his cigarette in his mouth red. He couldn't figure out why Miss Bao suddenly changed her attitude. Is this the end of their relationship? At the University of Berlin, he listened to the lecture on Eros by the famous Japanese professor EdSpranger, and understood that love and sexual desire are twins, which are similar but different. Sexual desire is not the basis of love, and love is not the sublimation of sexual desire. He has also read books such as love guides, and he knows the differences between the love of flesh and the love of heart. Miss Bao can't talk about heart and soul.",

She didn't change her mind, because she has no heart; It can only be said that the meat will go bad after a long time. Anyway, I didn't suffer, maybe I took advantage, and I have nothing to complain about. Fang Hung-chien consoled himself with such clever words and precise calculations, but disappointment, the lust of being cheated, and the pride of being hurt refused to lie down. Like a tumbler, he held it down and stood up again, but swayed with great interest.\r\nTomorrow, the east will be white, the speed of the ship will be reduced, and the sound of the machine will change its rhythm. Fang Hung-chien's fellow cabin guests packed their things long ago, and Hung-chien was still lying down, thinking that he would never see Miss Bao again. Anyway, he should be polite and considerate to see him off. Liu suddenly came in and asked him for a tip with a sad face. Hung-chien said angrily, \"Why do you need money now? There are still several days to go to Shanghai. \" Ah Liu told in a dumb voice that the men surnamed Sun were playing cards too loudly, and the French steward found out that they had a big fight, and their jobs were smashed, so they had to pack up and get off the boat later. Hung-chien listened, secretly calling for luck, and sent him away. At breakfast, those who got off the boat today were depressed. Mrs.Sun's eyes are red and swollen, and her eyes seem to be full of tears, like dew on petals in summer morning, and her fingers will fall off at the slightest touch. Miss Bao saw a new waiter and asked where Liu was, but no one answered her. Fang Hung-chien asked Miss Bao, \"You have a lot of luggage. Do you want me to walk you off the boat?\"\r\nMiss Bao said distantly, \"Thank you! Don't bother to drive, Mr.Li will come to the boat to pick me up. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"You can introduce Mr.Fang and Mr.Li.\"\r\nFang Hung-chien couldn't wait to crush every bone in Miss Su's thin body into lime powder. Miss Bao ignored her, drank a glass of milk, got up in a hurry and said that she had not finished packing. Fang Hung-chien put down his glass and followed out, ignoring the jokes. Miss Bao didn't look back. Fang Hung-chien called her. She said impatiently, \"I'm too busy to talk to you.\"\r\nJust when Fang Hung-chien didn't know how to lose his temper, Ah Liu appeared like a ghost and asked Miss Bao for drinks. Miss Bao's eyes sparkled and said, \"The reward for serving dinner was given yesterday. What else do you want? You are not in charge of my cabin. \"\r\nLiu didn't speak. He took a hairpin out of his pocket for a long time. It was Miss Bao who threw it away that day. He cleaned the floor and only found one of the three. Hung-chien wanted to scold Liu, but he couldn't help laughing when he took out such a magic weapon seriously. Miss Bao said bitterly, \"Are you still happy? You are happy, you give him money, I don't have a penny! \" Turned around and left.\r\nHung-chien prevented Ah Liu from being unwilling. When he saw Dr. Li's nonsense, he admitted that he was unlucky and gave him some money. A man went on deck and watched gloomily as the ship approached the Kowloon Wharf. Chinese and foreign passengers disembarked also came, and Hung-chien hid far away from Miss Bao.",

Chinese and foreign passengers disembarked also came, and Hung-chien hid far away from Miss Bao. The police, porters and hotel guests on the dock were shouting, and a group of people waved towels and gestured to the boat. Hung-chien thought that there must be Dr. Li, but he had to recognize him carefully. Very easy, the escalator docked, the port entry formalities were completed, and the passengers rushed to the boat. Miss Bao threw herself into the arms of a half-bald, fat black man with big glasses. This is her fiance who looks like herself! Like him? Scared, what an insult! Now I understand everything. What she said was simply seduction. I have always been complacent, thinking that she takes a fancy to herself a little. Who knows that she is at the mercy of her and will give her a snigger. Get rid of the old long white beard and moldy old saying: \"Women are the most terrible!\" \" There is nothing to say! Hung-chien was in a daze by the railing, but Miss Su said softly behind him, \"Mr.Fang is not getting off the boat, but thinking? They left Mr.Fang! No one to accompany. \"\r\nHung-chien turned around and saw Miss Su dressed up beautifully. I don't know what made him say, \"I'm afraid I won't be lucky if I want to accompany you. I'm not qualified!\"\r\nHe said this presumptuous thing, ready to hit a soft nail. Miss Su's cheeks were suddenly flushed with light rouge, like oil stains on paper, which spread all over her face in an instant, making her charming and shy. She could not lift her eyelids and said, \"We don't have that big face!\"\r\nHung-chien spread out his hand and said, \"I said before, people won't be honored!\"\r\nMiss Su said, \"I'm going to find a barber shop to wash my hair. Will you accompany me?\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Wonderful! I'm going to get a haircut. Let's get our hair cut and take a ferry to Hong Kong to go up the hill. When we get down, I'll treat you to dinner. After dinner, we'll have tea in Repulse Bay and watch a movie in the evening, okay? \"\r\nMiss Su said with a smile, \"Mr.Fang, you are so thoughtful! The whole day is planned. \" She doesn't know that Fang Hung-chien only sailed to Hong Kong once when he went abroad, and now he can't remember the direction.\r\nTwenty minutes later, Liu took his clothes bag in the dining room and waited for the French manager to check it out and go ashore. At the entrance of the cabin, he caught a glimpse of Fang Hung-chien behind Miss Su and walked down the escalator with his hand next to her waist. He couldn't help but be surprised, admired and despised, unable to express this complicated emotion, so he spat into the spittoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that \"girlfriend\" is the scientific name of \"lover\", which is more solemn, just as the rose is biologically called \"woody compound leaf plant of Rosaceae\", or the legal term for divorcing a wife is \"divorce by agreement\". After spending two days with Miss Su in Hong Kong, Fang Hung-chien realized that his girlfriend and lover were in fact totally different. Miss Su is the most ideal girlfriend, with brains, status, attitude and appearance, which can be regarded as a lady's family. Going to the same restaurant and theater with her does not lose her face.",

Miss Su is the most ideal girlfriend, with brains, status, attitude and appearance, which can be regarded as a lady's family. Going to the same restaurant and theater with her does not lose her face. Although they are very close, Fang Hung-chien is confident that his friendship with her will stop here, just like two parallel straight lines, no matter how close they are to each other and how long they are drawn, they will never get together. Only when Kowloon saw her blushing shyly before going ashore, her heart suddenly became too soft to jump, and she never felt this way again. He found that Miss Su has a lot of childishness. She can be naughty and simple and naive, which he never expected. But somehow, he always felt that such a girlish voice didn't match Miss Su. Not because she is old; She is not much older than Miss Bao, and in front of the man she loves, every woman has the stunt of rejuvenation. It can only be said that it is not suitable in character; For example, a kitten chasing its tail in circles makes us look funny, while a puppy chasing the past turns around and follows the short tail, which makes it less interesting. Those students who were on the same boat saw that they had just gone to Miss Bao, and they had already changed to Miss Su, making fun of him.\r\nMiss Su is a great person; In the five or six days before the ship arrived in Shanghai, there was not a word about Miss Bao. She is also much gentler with people. Fang Hung-chien didn't love her, except to give her a hand when she got on the boat and got off the boat and walked on the springboard, and he didn't hold her hand. However, Miss Su's accidental behavior seems to have a far-reaching and long-lasting relationship with him than marriage proposal, engagement and wedding. Her plainness made Hung-chien even more suspicious. He thought it was the super-passionate stability of love, as if the ocean was calm after the hurricane, and there were turbulent forces lurking under it at any time. After sailing in Hong Kong, he and Miss Su ate fruits bought in Hong Kong on the deck. He ate peaches and peeled them patiently. He also said, \"Why don't peaches look like bananas? How easy it is to peel them! Or simply like an apple, wipe it with a handkerchief and you can eat it with the skin. \" Miss Su peeled a few fresh lychees and ate them. She didn't eat anything anymore. She was willing to peel peaches for him, but he refused anyway. After eating the peach, his face and hands were covered with pretences, and Miss Su looked at him and smiled. He was afraid that the peach juice would stain his pants, so he just reached into his pocket and hooked his handkerchief twice. He finally pulled it out and was wiping his hands. Miss Su's voice was full of fear and disgust and said, \"Ouch! Why is your handkerchief so dirty! Thanks to you-Kuang! This thing won't wipe your mouth. Take mine. Take it. Don't push it. I don't like pushing it the most. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien blushed, took Miss Su's handkerchief, floated it on his mouth and wiped it. He said, \"I bought a dozen new handkerchiefs on board and lost half of them to the people who washed clothes on board. I lost this little thing easily, and they washed it slowly, so I had to wash it myself. I went ashore to play these two days, and I didn't have time to wash them. All the handkerchiefs were dirty, so I'll wash them later. Let me wash this handkerchief and return it to you. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Who wants you to wash it? You won't be clean if you wash it!",
        "59872565-4fae-4deb-aa6f-131145ad71bb": "Thanks to you-Kuang! This thing won't wipe your mouth. Take mine. Take it. Don't push it.

All the handkerchiefs were dirty, so I'll wash them later. Let me wash this handkerchief and return it to you. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Who wants you to wash it? You won't be clean if you wash it! I don't think your handkerchief has been cleaned at all. I'm afraid the greasy spots on it are still a souvenir from Marseille. I don't know how you washed it. \" When I spoke, I giggled.\r\nWait a minute, two people go down. Miss Su picked up a handkerchief of her own and gave it to Fang Hung-chien. \"You can use it for the time being. Let me wash your handkerchief.\" Fang Hung-chien was so flustered that he even said, \"That doesn't make sense!\" Miss Su pouted and said, \"You are really angry! What's the big deal? Give it to me quickly. \" Unable to help it, Hung-chien went back to the cabin and took out a bunch of wrinkled handkerchiefs. He begged for forgiveness and said, \"I can wash it myself! It's very dirty, and you will find it disgusting. \" Miss Su snatched it away and shook her head. \"How can you be so sloppy?\". Will you just wipe this thing with apples? \" Fang Hung-chien was worried about this all day. He thanked Miss Su and said \"mother-in-law\" to her. Tomorrow, he moved the canvas chair for Miss Su, and with some effort, two buttons popped off her shirt. Miss Su laughed at him as a \"little fat man\" and told him to change his shirt back and give it to her to nail the buttons. It's useless for him to protest. Miss Su wants whatever she says, so he has to obey her well-meaning dictatorship.\r\nSeeing that the general situation was not good, Fang Hung-chien panicked. Washing handkerchiefs, mending socks, and sewing buttons are all small obligations that the wife does to her husband. Why should I enjoy these rights? Of course, if she enjoys the rights of her husband, she should be her husband. Otherwise, why would she fulfill these obligations? Is there anything she can say that can give her a mistake for her husband? Fang Hung-chien's hair stood on end at the thought of this. If the engagement ring is a symbol of falling into a trap, the button is also a sign of being detained. You have to watch yourself! Fortunately, I will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, so I won't have such a chance to get close, and the danger can be reduced. However, in these two days, he was with Miss Su, either afraid that the socks would suddenly wear out, or worried that the button would come off somewhere. He knew that Miss Su's service was not easy to be ungrateful. Every time she tacks a button or fills a hole, her conscience adds a point of responsibility to propose to her.\r\nSino-Japanese relations are getting worse every day, and the report on the ship's radio worries them. On the afternoon of August 9, the ship arrived in Shanghai, but luckily the war did not happen. Miss Su gave Fang Hung-chien the address and asked him to play. He promised that he would come to Shanghai to visit her when he went back to his hometown to see his parents. Miss Su's brother came on the boat to meet Fang Hung-chien, so Miss Su introduced him to her brother. Her brother looked Hung-chien over and shook hands very politely. \"I've heard a lot about you! I have heard for a long time! \" Hung-chien thought to himself, Oh, no! Shit! This introduction is even approved by her family representative to be an alternate son-in-law! At the same time, it is strange that her brother said \"I have heard a lot\". Miss Su must have often told her family about herself before, and she was a little happy.",

At the same time, it is strange that her brother said \"I have heard a lot\". Miss Su must have often told her family about herself before, and she was a little happy. He resigned from the Su brothers and sisters to check the luggage. After a few steps, he turned around and saw his brother smiling at his sister. Her sister blushed, like liking and angry, knowing that she was talking about herself. Sorry for a while. Suddenly I met his brother Peng Tu, but I went to the second class to look for him. Miss Su has an acquaintance at the customs, so the luggage is exempt from inspection and release. The Fang brothers are still waiting for inspection, and Miss Su has come to hold hands with Hung-chien and say goodbye. Peng Tu asked who it was, and Hung-chien said his surname was Su. Peng Tu said, \"Alas, it's a doctor in France. I read about it in the newspaper.\" Hung-chien sneered and despised the vanity of women. Tidy up the checked boxes, call a car and prepare to stay at manager Zhou's house for one night, and return home tomorrow. In what bank did Pengtu work as a clerk? The wind was bad these two days and he was busy moving the warehouse, so he got off the bus halfway. Hung-chien asked him to send a telegram home and tell him which train to take tomorrow. Pengtu felt that the money was wasted unnecessarily and only made a long-distance call.\r\nHis father-in-law and mother-in-law were overjoyed to see him. He sent his father-in-law a cane with ivory handle bought in Ceylon, his mother-in-law who loves playing cards and believes in Buddhism, a French handbag and two leaves of Ceylon, and a German fountain pen to his brother-in-law who was fifteen or sixteen years old. My mother-in-law thought of her daughter who had been dead for five years, and cried sadly, \"If Shuying were alive, she would be happy if you came back from studying abroad today!\" Manager Zhou choked up and said that his wife was senile, so why did she say those words on a happy day today? Hung-chien's face was serious and gloomy, but he was full of shame, because he had never thought of his fiancee in the past four years. The big photo of his fiancee that his father-in-law gave him as a souvenir when he went abroad was also placed at the bottom of the box, and I wonder if it had faded. He wanted to make amends. Anyway, he took the special express train at 11: 30 tomorrow and had time to go to the World Cemetery. He said, \"I wanted to visit her grave tomorrow morning.\" Manager Zhou and his wife have a better impression of Hung-chien. Mrs.Zhou showed him the room where Shu Ying slept tonight, which was the room where Shu Ying lived. Put two photos on the dressing table: one is Shu Ying's remains, and the other is her doctor's photo. Fang Hung-chien looked in a daze and felt that Shu-ying had both died, and the depression was bleak, which made him feel lost behind him.\r\nAt dinner, the father-in-law knew that Hung-chien's job had not been settled in the second half of the year, and comforted him and said, \"This is not a problem. I think you'd better find a job in Shanghai or Nanjing. The situation in Peiping is dangerous and you can't go. You go home for two weeks, and then you come out and live with me. I'll put a name in my bank for you. You can go for a walk during the day and teach my son at night while looking for opportunities. OK or not? You don't have to take your luggage with you. It's so hot that you have to wear China clothes when you go home. \"",

My mother-in-law mentioned his marriage and asked him if he had a girlfriend. He quickly said no. My father-in-law said, \"I know you won't have it.\" Your grandfather has a good family education, and you behave yourself. You won't have any free love, and free love won't have a good result. \"\r\n\"Hung-chien is so honest that he can't find a woman,\" said his mother-in-law. Let me be a matchmaker for him. \"\r\nThe father-in-law said, \"There you go again! His old man and old lady are afraid they won't be the masters. We can't control it. \"\r\nMother-in-law said, \"Hung-chien spent our money when he went abroad. He married a daughter-in-law. Of course, he can't leave our Zhou family alone. Hung-chien, right? You will be a new wife, and you must be my goddaughter. I said this in your ears, don't have a new relative, forget the old one! I have seen many such heartless people. \"\r\nHung-chien had to smile bitterly and said, \"Don't worry, never.\" I said to Miss Su's shadow in my heart, \"Listen! Will you worship this lady as a godmother? Luckily I don't want to marry you. \" His brother-in-law seemed to follow his heart and say, \"Brother Hung-chien, there is a female student named Su. Do you know her?\" Fang Hung-chien was so horrified that he almost lost his job. He thought that American behavioral psychologists only proved that \"thought is a silent language\". What is the structure of this boy's ear? How can he hear all the silent secrets in his heart! Before he answered, his father-in-law said, \"Yes! I forgot-Xiaocheng, go and get that newspaper-I received your photo, so I taught Director Wang of the Literature Department to publish a news story. I know you don't like to show off, but it's a matter of face and you don't have to hide it. \" The last few words were said because Hong gradually changed his face.\r\n\"That's right,\" said my mother-in-law. After losing a lot of money, why not be decent! \"\r\nHung-chien had blushed with shame and indignation. He went to his brother-in-law to get the newspaper, took a look, pinched his ears, even his neck, and blushed down his back until he reached his heel. That is the Shanghai newspaper in early July. There are two small photos printed in the education news column. The copperplate is blurred, much like the ghost photos taken on the altar. According to the news in the previous photo, Wen Wan, a state councilor Su Hongye, returned to China with a doctorate at the University of Lyon. There are twice as many news words in the photo behind. It is said that Zhou Houqing, the general manager of the local business community, is the son-in-law of Fang Hung-chien, who was sent abroad by Zhou Junzi for further study, studying in universities in London, France, Berlin, Germany, and studying politics, economy, history, society and other subjects. He has excellent grades and is among the best. He was awarded a doctorate in philosophy by Clayton University in Germany, and will travel to various countries and return home in autumn. Hung-chien wished he couldn't tear the newspaper in half and choke Director Wang's throat to see how many disgusting formulas he could squeeze out for his resume. No wonder Miss Su's brother said \"I've heard a lot about her\" when they met. No wonder Pengtu knew that she was a doctor studying abroad when she heard that her surname was Su.",

At that time, I laughed at her cliche! This news like myself is the evil custom of crowning to the extreme, and it stinks so much that readers have to hold their noses. Besides, he is a real doctor. What is he? I never talked to Miss Su about the degree on the boat. When she saw the news, she would conclude that she was bragging and cheating. Where is Clayton University in Germany? When writing a letter, I vaguely said that I got a degree. When my husband read that the letter was sent from Germany, he arbitrarily said that it was a German university. If the insiders knew it, wouldn't he smile? I became a liar and never saw anyone again!\r\nMrs.Zhou saw Fang Hung-chien holding a newspaper and covering his face. She smiled and said to her husband, \"Look at how proud Hung-chien is. He won't let go of that news after reading it several times.\"\r\nXiaocheng said mischievously, \"Brother Hung-chien is carefully recognizing that Su Wenwan and wants to marry her instead of her sister.\"\r\nFang Hung-chien couldn't help saying, \"Don't talk nonsense!\" It's easy to control myself, not throwing the newspaper on the ground, not letting shame and anger show on my face, but my throat is sand.\r\nMr.and Mrs.Zhou were a little surprised when they saw Hung-chien's smile. They suddenly winked at each other, as if they understood Hung-chien's psychology, and they all said, \"You should hit him. Who wants you to interrupt when adults are talking? Brother Hung-chien just came back today. Of course, he was unhappy when he thought of your sister. You have to have a sense of proportion when you tell jokes, and you are not allowed to speak in the future-Hung-chien, we know that you are naturally born, and children talk nonsense, so don't pay attention to him. \" Hung-chien's face turned red again, and his mouth was full of bones. He complained to himself, \"Don't put on makeup! You have the ability to never marry a wife. I don't want your pen, just take it back. \"\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien went to his room to sleep, he found that Shuying's photo was not on the table. He thought that his mother-in-law had come to take it away because she was afraid of thinking about things and losing sleep. It's only been six or seven hours since I got off the boat, but everything on board is like a lifetime ago. The excitement when I went ashore evaporated, and I felt weak and insignificant. It was not easy to find a job and fall in love. The ideal of returning to China after studying abroad is like the water on the ground, which turns into gas and rises to the sky, and then turns into rain and returns to the ground. People all over the world are watching and talking. Now that Wan Li has returned to his hometown, there is no bubble in the people's sea of the motherland-no, it was boasted by Director Wang, and he was blown into a big soap bubble, which was colorful before it was broken, and he could not stand the sight of people. He looked out through the screen window. The stars in the sky are dense and busy. They are silent, but it seems that they only feel the excitement in the sky. A comb like the moon describes an immature girl, but she is not shy when she sees people, and the light and outline are fresh and engraved, which can gradually set off the night scene. Insects in the small garden grass talk at night in trivial ways. I don't know where the frogs, Qi Xin, work together to make a bugle call, like the sound of the fire boiling.",

A few fireflies swim and come, unlike flying, like floating in thick air. In the dark place where the moonlight can't reach, a little firefly flashes, like a little green eye on a summer night. Hung-chien used to see this scenery before going abroad, but when he saw it at this time, his heart suddenly squeezed and his eyes were so sore that he was about to cry. Only then did he realize the goodness of life and the happiness of returning home. The news in Shanghai Daily was as indifferent as the buzzing mosquitoes outside the screen window. Hung-chien sighed comfortably and yawned again.\r\nFang Hung-chien got off at the county railway station, and Mr.Fang, his third brother Feng Yi, seven or eight cousins and Mr.Fang's friends met him on the platform. He was very sorry. He greeted each other one by one and said, \"I'm sorry for such a hot day!\" Seeing that his father's beard turned gray again, he said, \"Dad, why did you come!\" \"\r\nFang Tun-weng gave Hung-chien the folding fan in his hand and said, \"You friends in suits don't need this antique, but it's better than fanning it with a straw hat.\" Seeing that his son was sitting in the second class, he praised him and said, \"This child is good! When he returned to China, he took the second-class train. I thought he must take the first-class train. He still took the second-class train. He didn't want to be arrogant and changed his true colors. He already understood the truth of being a man. \" Everyone echoed the praise for a while. Crowded in front and hugged behind, he went out of the ticket gate. Suddenly, a man in blue glasses and a suit grabbed Hung-chien and said, \"Please don't move! Take a picture. \" Puzzled, Hung-chien was about to ask him why, when he heard the camera click and his blue glasses let go. It turned out that there was another person pointing the fast mirror at himself. Blue glasses took out his business card and said, \"Dr. Fang returned to the motherland yesterday?\" The man with the fast mirror came and took out a business card. When Hung-chien saw it, he was a reporter from two local daily newspapers in this county. The two reporters all said, \"Dr. Fang has a long journey today, and he will go to the government to teach tomorrow morning.\" He turned to compliment Mr.Fang and accompanied him out of the station. Feng Yi smiled at Hung-chien and said, \"Brother, you are a celebrity in this county.\" Although Hung-chien thought that the two reporters kept calling themselves \"Dr. Fang\", which was very harsh, he saw that people took themselves seriously as a statue, and their body and mind swelled, and their personality became better. He didn't know it was cheap to live in a small place. He only hated that he didn't change into a relatively new suit today, didn't take a cane, waved a big folding fan in his hand, and was sweating all over his face. He was afraid that taking pictures would not be good.\r\nWhen I got home, I met my mother and two sisters-in-law, and sent the gifts I brought back. Mother smiled and said, \"I want to go abroad. If I study so carefully, I will buy everything that women use.\"\r\nThe father said, \"Peng Tu talked about a Miss Su on the phone yesterday. What happened?\"\r\nFang Hung-chien said angrily, \"We're just in the same boat. It's nothing at all. Peng Tu always likes to talk. \"",

He was afraid that taking pictures would not be good.\r\nWhen I got home, I met my mother and two sisters-in-law, and sent the gifts I brought back. Mother smiled and said, \"I want to go abroad. If I study so carefully, I will buy everything that women use.\"\r\nThe father said, \"Peng Tu talked about a Miss Su on the phone yesterday. What happened?\"\r\nFang Hung-chien said angrily, \"We're just in the same boat. It's nothing at all. Peng Tu always likes to talk. \" He was going to scold Peng Tu for gossiping, but he didn't say it in front of Mrs.Peng Tu.\r\nThe father said, \"It's time for you to get married. Both brothers have already married daughters-in-law and have children. There are several matchmakers, but now you don't need us old haters to make decisions for you. Su Hongye, on the other hand, is a bit famous. He seems to have held several posts in the past-\"Hung-chien thought to himself, why do all lovely girls have fathers? She can hide in her heart alone, dragging her father, uncle, brother and so on. This girl is not smart and free and easy, and it is inconvenient to harbor her in her heart, so her loveliness is mixed with dross. Many people talk about marriage as if it were gay love, not because of the girl herself, but because they envy her father or her brother.\r\nMother said, \"I don't agree! Miss Guan can't be married. If you want to serve her, she won't serve you. And marry a daughter-in-law to a fellow countryman. People from other counties are always a little out of temper, so it's useless for you to marry. Miss Su is an international student, and she is afraid of her age. \" Her two middle schools didn't graduate, and the daughter-in-law who grew up in this county all had praise and expression.\r\nThe father said, \"I am not only studying abroad, but also a doctor. So I'm afraid Hung-chien can't stand her. \" -It seems that Miss Su is a hard thing like masonry, which cannot be digested by the stomach of an ostrich or a turkey.\r\nNot convinced, his mother said, \"We Hung-chien is also a doctor. We can't lose to her. Why can't we match her?\"\r\nFather twisted his beard and smiled, \"Hung-chien, your mother won't understand this truth-a woman who has read a few books is the most difficult to master.\" Men must be a layer taller than her and cannot match her equally. That's why college graduates marry middle school girls and foreign students marry college girls. Only foreigners dare to marry a woman who has a Ph.D. in studying abroad, or a man is at least a doctor with both. Hung-chien, am I right? This is the same as' marrying a woman must win my family, and marrying a woman must not be like my family'. \"\r\nMother said, \"The second daughter of the Xu family is the best in the few years of matchmaking. I'll show you the photos later.\"\r\nFang Hung-chien thought it was serious. The modern girl who hates small cities the most in her life, the outdated fashion and the urbanization of rural flavor, just like the first suit made by a tailor in China, patched up the old clothes of foreigners who were pretending, and made them on sleeves and trousers as usual. There is no need to protest now, and in a few days, I will run away to Shanghai. Mr.Fang also said that there were many people on the reception, and the weather was too hot. He told Hung-chien to be careful not to be greedy, and all his close elders had to pay a visit, and let him take his own chartered car. When the weather was a little cooler, he personally took him to his grandfather's grave to salute. Mrs.Fang said that the tailor would be called to make his silk gown and underwear tomorrow. Feng Yi had two gowns, so she borrowed one for the time being and went out to pay a visit. At dinner, Mrs.Fang cooked fried shredded eel, sauce chicken wings, stewed chicken with watermelon, and boiled shrimp with wine, all of which were the favorite local flavors of the eldest son.",

Mrs.Fang picked out the good ones and sent them to his rice bowl, saying, \"I think it's pathetic that you have been abroad for four years, and you have nothing to eat!\" \" Everyone laughed and said that she came again. If she didn't eat in a foreign country, she would starve to death. She said, \"I don't understand how foreign devils live! Don't eat any bread or milk for me. \" Hung-chien suddenly felt that in this family atmosphere, war was unbelievable, just as no one thought of ghosts in broad daylight. Father and mother's plans and hopes leave no room for accidents. Seeing that they are so steadily supporting the future, I am also emboldened. I think that the situation in Shanghai may be moderate, and the war will not happen. If it does happen, I can ignore it.\r\nFang Hung-chien won't get up until tomorrow, and the two reporters left the door this morning. Hung-chien felt ashamed when he saw the news that Dr. Fang had returned to his hometown in the newspaper they brought, embedded with the full-length portrait taken yesterday. The hand that blue glasses pulled his right arm was clearly taken in, and with the look of surprise on his side face, it was like a thief being caught in photography. That blue glasses is a well-informed person, and it is said that Clayton University is the most famous institution in the world, and its status is like that of Tsinghua University. The reporter with a camera asked Hung-chien what he had observed about the general trend of the world and whether the Sino-Japanese war would break out. Fang Hung-chien finally sent them away, and wrote two words of advice for the newspaper with blue glasses and the newspaper with camera. Just about to go out to pay a visit, my father's old friend, President Lu of the provincial middle school in this county, came, and the Fang and his son were invited to have breakfast in the teahouse tomorrow morning. After eating, Hung-chien was invited to give a speech to the summer school students on \"The influence of western culture in the history of China and its review\". Hung-chien was most afraid of giving a speech, and he had to make an excuse to decline. Who knew that his father would promise on his behalf? He had to swallow air conditioning in private, thinking that in such a hot day, he wore a robe, talked nonsense and sweated. What is it not a living sin? Educators' psychology is really different from that of people! Mr.Fang hoped that people would praise his son's \"family origin\" and turned out several thread-bound books in the box, such as Wen Zi Tang Ji, Gui Si Lei Ji, Qi Jing Lou Ji, Tan Ying Lu and so on, and told Hung-chien to read them carefully and collect speech materials. Hung-chien read it with relish all afternoon and learned a lot. He understood that China was square in character and smooth in foreigners' character, so he advocated that the land was round. China people's heart position is in the middle, while westerners' heart position is to the left; Opium imported from the west is poisonous and must be banned. China is peaceful in nature, and the opium produced will not be addictive if smoked. Syphilis is smallpox, from the west and so on. Unfortunately, although these facts are interesting, you don't need them in your speech, so you should cram for another lesson. So when he came back from his uncle's house for dinner that day, he was so drunk that he turned over three or five history textbooks, filled up a speech of more than 1000 words and penetrated two jokes. This kind of preparation doesn't take much effort, but it loses some blood because there are many mosquitoes.",

President Lu paid the bill, urged Hung-chien to get up, and each of them took the gown from the waiter and put it on. Feng Yi accompanied Mr.Fang for tea. The school auditorium was already full of students, with more than 200 men and women. Fang Hung-chien was accompanied on the platform by President Lu, only to feel that many eyes were numb and itchy, and it was inconvenient to walk. When I sat down on the stage, the wet fog in front of me dissipated, only to see that all the teachers in the first row were sitting like our school, and the record seat next to the podium was a female student, and the newly-permed wavy board looked like paint. All the people in the auditorium are whispering and admiring themselves curiously. He silently shared his cheeks and said, \"Don't burn the dishes! Don't blush! \" I regret that I shouldn't have taken off my sunglasses when I entered the door. Two pieces of black glass in front of me seem to be hidden in the dark, so I'm not shy. President Lu was already giving an introduction to the speech. Hung-chien reached into his coat pocket and felt for the manuscript of the speech. He felt nothing but a cold sweat. I think it's bad! Shit! How could you lose something important? When I came out at home, I put it in my coat bag. Except for the first few words, the rest were completely forgotten. Remembering desperately is just like putting a sieve to hold water. When you are in a hurry, you can't concentrate, and the clues of your thoughts will be tied and loose. There are still some shadows of the facts, but it is like waiting for someone in a busy place. It looks like him in the crowd, goes up to look for it, and disappears again. Being fascinated by Tibet, President Lu bowed and asked him to give a speech, and there was a burst of applause below. As soon as he stood up, Feng Yi rushed into the auditorium in a rage. Seeing that the speech had begun, he desperately found a vacant seat. Hung-chien suddenly realized that when he left the teahouse, he accidentally put on Feng Yi's clothes by mistake. These two coats were all Feng Yi's, and the colors and materials were the same. At this point, I have to be bold and talk nonsense for a while.\r\nWhen the applause stopped, Fang Hung-chien forced a smile and said, \"President Lu, gentlemen and students, although your applause was well-intentioned, it was actually the most unreasonable. Because applause means that I am satisfied with the speech, and now I haven't spoken, and you have applauded with satisfaction. Why should I say anything more? You should listen to the speech first, and then clap your hands at will to make me have face to step down. Now I applaud first, and my speech can't afford such warm applause. Instead, I feel a fear of not paying the money. \" The audience laughed, and the girl who recorded it also smiled and walked like a fly. Fang Hung-chien hesitated. What shall we talk about next? I still remember a thing or two about the arguments and facts in the thread-bound book. The history textbook I read after dinner is gone. Damn textbooks, when I was a student, it was a pity that I would read them well and take the exam! Got it, got it! It's better than nothing to say: \"You can find the influence of western culture in the history of China in any history textbook, so I don't need to repeat it.",

As you all know, it was in the middle of the Ming Dynasty that European ideas formally contacted China. So Catholics often say that it was the Renaissance in China. However, the science brought by Catholic priests in the Ming Dynasty is out of date now, and the religion they brought has never been timely. Haitong for hundreds of years, only two western things have survived in the whole China society. One is opium and the other is syphilis, both of which are western civilizations absorbed by the Ming Dynasty. \" Most of the audience laughed and a few of them opened their mouths in horror; Several teachers frowned, and the girl who recorded it blushed and stopped writing, as if after listening to Hung-chien's last sentence, the virgin's ear had lost her virginity in public; President Lu coughed behind Hung-chien's back with warning meaning. At that time, Fang Hung-chien was like a person who got up in the middle of winter morning. It was easy to jump out of bed with his best efforts. He had to get out of bed with cold clothes and never shrank back. \"Opium was originally called foreign smoke-\"Hung-chien saw an old man who taught Chinese in the teacher shaking his head while fanning his fan. \"This\" foreign \"of course refers to the\" Western Ocean \"where Sanbao eunuch went to the Western Ocean, because according to the Ming Dynasty Code, opium is a tribute from Siam and Java. But in the earliest literary work in Europe, Homer's epic \"Ten Years Return\" Odyssey-\"The old man's baldness was shocked by this foreign word-\"It is said that there is this thing. As for syphilis-\"President Lu repeatedly coughed-\"it is undoubtedly imported foreign goods. Schopenhauer said earlier that the first characteristic of modern European civilization was Myrica rubra sore. If you don't have a chance to see the original foreign book, it's easy. Just look at the French novel \"De Di De\" translated by Mr.Xu Zhimo, and you can get a glimpse of the origin of syphilis. After zhengde in Ming dynasty, the disease was brought by foreigners. Of course, these two things are pernicious, but they can't be completely erased. Opium inspired many literary works. Ancient poets sought inspiration from wine, while modern European and American poets got inspiration from opium. Syphilis is genetically idiotic, crazy and disabled, but it is said that it can also stimulate genius. For example, \"President Lu's throat was broken at this time. When Hung-chien finished speaking, the audience clapped their hands, but it was still strong. President Lu said with a dumb face,\" Today, Dr. Cheng Fang told us many novel discussions, and we felt very interested. Dr. Fang is my nephew. I have watched him grow up since I was a child, and I know that he likes telling jokes. It's very hot today, so he intends to say something humorous. I hope to have a chance to hear his serious remarks in the future. But I would like to tell Dr. Fang that our school library is full of the spirit of a new life, and there are absolutely no French novels-\"I said with my hand in the air.\" Hung-chien was too ashamed to watch the audience.\r\nBy tomorrow, many people will know that Fang's son, who came back from studying abroad, publicly advocated smoking and whoring. This word came to Mr.Fang's ears. He didn't know that this was the result of teaching his son to turn over thread-bound books. He didn't agree with it, but it was not good.",

Following the news of the Battle of Shanghai and Shanghai on August 13th, Fang Hung-chien's jokes were never mentioned again. But those who have daughters to marry him will never forget his speech; I guess he is in a foreign country, and if he marries him for his daughter, he will go to the West Lake Moon Temple for the Elderly and ask for a visa. It is hard to guarantee that it will not be the fourth sign: \"The Sri Lankan also has a disease!\" This kind of young man can't be a son-in-law, so he took back his daughter's photos and wedding invitations from the Fang family on the pretext that the times were not calm and the marriage was postponed. Mrs.Fang was so depressed that she was obsessed with Miss Hsu's second wife, but Hung-chien seemed as if nothing had happened. The war has started, and Mr.Fang is a big squire, busy with local public security affairs. The residents of the county remember that they were not bombed by enemy planes on the \"1.28\" occasion, and they thought nothing about it this time, and they were not very frightened. Fang Hung-chien lived in his home for a week, and he felt that during his four years abroad, he left no trace of his hometown like water spilled on a lotus leaf. When I came back, I met those people four years ago. Those people still did what they did and said what they said four years ago. Not even one of the people I know died; Only one's own wet nurse, who used to say that she would wait until she got married and raised her son to hold the baby, is now too ill to get up. These four years have been wasted in my hometown, and I can't get a tear or a sigh from the returning wanderer. On the sixth day after the war, Japanese planes dropped bombs for the first time, which collapsed the railway station. Only then did everyone realize that the war had really hit the door, and some people moved to the countryside to take refuge. In the future, planes will patronize one after another, and there will be a peerless beauty who cares about the whole city and then the country. Manager Zhou telegraphed Hung-chien to Shanghai soon, otherwise the traffic would be cut off and he would have to stay at home. Mr.Fang also felt that in this situation, his son should go out and look for opportunities quickly, so he let Hung-chien go. In the next four months, when we retreated from Shanghai to the fall of Nanjing, history should be like what Fr.von Logau said: sharpen the bayonet as a pen, dip it in blood as ink, and write it on the enemy's skin as paper. Fang Hung-chien was in a daze, reading more than a dozen newspapers and listening to more than a dozen radio reports a day. He was so tired that he hoped to find a rest place in the news. He and Peng Tu suspected that the family had been destroyed and their whereabouts were unknown. They were not found until the end of the lunar calendar, and Mr.Fang's relatives and friends in Shanghai tried to pay for them to come out and rent a house in the concession for them. The family met and sobbed. Mr.Fang and Feng Yi clamored for shoes and socks; When they came by boat, they met two defeated soldiers on the way and robbed Mr.Fang of his wallet. Before leaving, they forced Mr.Fang and his son to take off their wool socks and cotton shoes and exchange them with their smelly socks and broken canvas shoes. Fang's family went empty-handed, except for Mrs.Fang's cotton-padded jacket with two or three thousand dollars sewn in it, which the two soldiers didn't touch.",

Fang's family went empty-handed, except for Mrs.Fang's cotton-padded jacket with two or three thousand dollars sewn in it, which the two soldiers didn't touch. Businessmen from the same hometown in Shanghai always praised the name of Mr.Fang and gave a lot of money, so the portal can be supported again. Fang Hung-chien, seeing that his family is large and his house is small, still lives in Zhou's house and pays his respects to his parents every other day or two. Every time I go home, I always listen to their terrible and ridiculous experiences of fleeing; It seems that the art of their narration and description has improved every time, but Hung-chien's attention and sympathy have declined every time. Because Mr.Fang refused the temptation of traitors in this county, his family was difficult to return home, but the government didn't give him any name. He felt that he was patriotic and the country didn't love him, and many young chaste widows didn't like Weng Gu's resentment. Hung-chien was very stuffy in Dianjin Bank, and Shanghai didn't have much chance, so he wanted to go to the mainland if he wanted.\r\nThe lunar new year is coming. The residents in the Shanghai Concession have had enough fear for their country. Now that the country is not dead, they don't have to be survivors, so they are busy as usual. One day, Mrs.Zhou told Hung-chien that there was a matchmaker for him, that is, once Hung-chien went out to socialize with Manager Zhou and sat with a daughter named Zhang. According to Mrs.Zhou, the Zhang family asked the fortune-teller to arrange for him to go, so as to make a \"perfect match\" with their young lady's life. Hung-chien said with a smile, \"In an open place like Shanghai, do you still want fortune tellers to dominate the marriage?\" Mrs.Zhou said that you can't trust your life. Mr.Zhang invited him to have a casual dinner, so it's no harm to know the lady. Hung-chien was a bit of a scholar before the war. I remember that Zhang was a comprador in an American foreign firm and didn't want to associate with such worldly things, but on second thought, he had not used bourgeois money since he went abroad. Anyway, it doesn't hurt to go once. Whether you get married or not depends on whether you like the girl or not. Others reluctantly agreed to go to dinner. This Mr.Zhang is from Zhejiang coastal area, and his name is Jimin, but he likes to be called Jimmy. He has worked in American Citigroup for more than 20 years, from \"writing\" (small secretary) to comprador, and he really has money in his hand. Having only one daughter, I don't hesitate to cultivate at work, teach the foreign skills and habits that can be edified in the church school, and the foreign fashions and attitudes that the beauty salon and barber shop can create. The daughter is just eighteen years old and has not graduated from middle school, but Mr.and Mrs.Zhang keep the traditional idea of their hometown, thinking that girls will be old when they are twenty, and they will not be married until they are over twenty, so they can only go to the antique exhibition for people to mourn. Mrs.Zhang is very strict about her husband's choice, and although there are many matchmakers, they have failed. There is a son of a wealthy businessman who is also an international student. Mrs.Zhang is quite appreciative and has great prospects for marriage, but this matter will not be mentioned after a meal. At dinner, everyone talked about the difficulty in obtaining vegetables in those days because of the war, the blockade of the concession, and Mrs.Zhang said to the rich businessman's son, \"There are many people in your family, so the daily food bill will not be small, right?\" The man said he didn't know how much it was a day.",
        "a49c8e3f-c32f-486f-8f34-5a3279430ed2": "Mrs.Zhang is very strict about her husband's choice, and although there are many matchmakers, they have failed.

Mrs.Zhang said, \"Then your cook must be honest and capable! Like our number is less than half of your family, we have to spend that amount on the kitchen every day! \" The man listened proudly, and Mrs.Zhang waited for him to leave after dinner, then said, \"This kind of ostentation and extravagance is too small! Only eat so much money for a day's food! My daughter is comfortable and used to it. She couldn't suffer in the past! \" The marriage is over. After several consultations, the couple felt that their baby daughter was always worried about marrying someone else, so it was better to recruit a son-in-law to come to their home. That day, Mr.Zhang and Hung-chien sat at the same table and went home to talk about it. They thought it was quite qualified: the family title was good, and now it is not really true that the son-in-law has lived in the nominal father-in-law's house, so it is easy to get married in the future. What's even better is that after this war, the Fang family can't afford to put on airs of the squire family, and this son-in-law can be kept in the Zhang family. As a result, Mrs.Zhang asked Hung-chien to come home and meet him.\r\nFang Hung-chien, because Mr.Zhang asked him to come early to talk, went after the bank office in the afternoon. On the street, I passed a foreign fur shop and saw an otter velvet suit jacket, which was cheap in the New Year and only sold for 400 yuan. Hung-chien often wanted to have such a coat, but he was afraid to buy it when studying abroad. For example, in London, men wear fur coats and don't have private cars. If they don't look like Jews who put money on stamps or black boxers, people suspect that they are circus performers or turtles who run kiln. Only in Vienna is it common to wear leather coats, and there are ready-made leather linings sold to passengers to line their coats. After he returned to China, many people saw through it, and now he is even more impressed by the display in the window of that shop. But after thinking about it, I had to sigh. A salary of 100 yuan in the bank is not thin, and zero is enough. My husband's family provides food and shelter, and there is no need to post a penny. How can I ask Manager Zhou for money to buy luxury goods? I returned home with more than 60 pounds, and this time I gave my father 40 pounds to buy some furniture, but the rest was only equivalent to more than 400 yuan. It's not cost-effective to spend all my money on this coat. During the national disaster, everything is economical, not to mention that the weather will pick up soon, so it will be saved. When he arrived in Zhangjia, Mr.Zhang warmly welcomed him: \"Hello! Doctor Fang [1], long time no see! \" Mr.Zhang is used to dealing with foreigners, and his speech has a characteristic-perhaps in foreign firms, YMCA, rotary clubs and other circles, this is nothing strange-and he likes to put unnecessary English words in Chinese. He has no new ideas that Chinese is difficult to reach, and he needs to speak in English; Therefore, the English words embedded in his speech are not as good as the gold teeth embedded in his mouth, because gold teeth are not only cosmetic, but also usable, so they have to be better than the meat scraps embedded in his teeth, indicating that the food is good and useless. He imitates American pronunciation perfectly, and perhaps he has gone too far in nasal learning, unlike Americans, but like an China with a cold and a stuffy nose. He said the word \"very well\" [2], which sounded like a small foreign dog purring-\"vurry wul\". It's a pity that the Romans didn't have such a blessing, otherwise they would never just say that R is a nasal dog letter.",

It's a pity that the Romans didn't have such a blessing, otherwise they would never just say that R is a nasal dog letter. At that time, Mr.Zhang shook hands with Hung-chien and asked him if he was \"going down\" every day [3]. When Hung-chien had finished his pleasantries, he saw bowls, bottles and plates in the glass cupboard and said, \"Does Mr.Zhang like to collect porcelain?\"\r\n\u3000\u3000\u201cSure\uff01 have a look see\uff01\u201d [4] Mr.Zhang opened the cupboard door and invited Hung-chien to appreciate it. Hung-chien took a few pieces, which were all \"Chenghua\", \"Xuande\" and \"Kangxi\", but he didn't know the truth, so he had to say, \"Is this valuable?\"\r\n\u3000\u3000\u201cSure\uff01 It's worth a lot of money, Plenty of dough. And this thing is no better than calligraphy and painting. Buying a fake painting and calligraphy is worthless, just equal to waste paper. The porcelain is fake, at least it can hold food and rice. I sometimes invite foreign friends to dinner, and I use the Kangxi kiln's' blue and colorful oil bottom' market to make salad dish. They all feel antique and the food tastes a little old-time. \" [5]\r\nFang Hung-chien said, \"Mr.Zhang must have a good eye and won't buy fake things.\"\r\nMr.Zhang laughed and said, \"I don't know any chronological patterns. I'm busy and I don't have time to read books and study them.\" But I have hunch\uff1b; When I saw something, I suddenly had a brainwave and bought a quasi-O.K. Their antique brokers admire me, and I often say to them,' Don't fool me with fakes. O yeah, my surname is Zhang, not sucker. Don't try to lie to me!' [6] After closing the cupboard door, he said, \"Hey, headache-\"and rang the bell to call the servant.\r\nHung-chien didn't understand, so he quickly asked, \"Mr.Zhang isn't feeling well, is he?\"\r\nMr.Zhang looked at Hung-chien in surprise and said, \"Who's sick? You? Me? I'm fine! \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Didn't Mr.Zhang say' headache'?\"\r\nMr.Zhang laughed, and the maid who came in said, \"Go and tell the ladies and gentlemen that the guests are here and ask them to come out. make it snappy\uff01\u201d [7] When speaking, the thumb of the right hand flicked from the middle finger to the index finger. He turned to Hung-chien and said with a smile, \"headache means' madam' in American, not' headache'! You haven't been to States! \" [8]\r\nFang Hung-chien was ashamed of himself when Mrs.Zhang and Miss Zhang came out and Mr.Zhang introduced him. Mrs.Zhang is a fat woman in her forties, and her foreign name is delicate Tessie. Miss Zhang is an eighteen-year-old tall girl with bright colors and tight clothes, and her figure will be as strong as that of her old man's foreign firm in the future. Hung-chien didn't catch her name clearly, and her voice sounded like \"I miss you and him\". She thought it was either Anita or Juanita, and her parents only shortened her name to Nita. Mrs.Zhang speaks Shanghai dialect better than her husband, but she always reveals her local accent, as if the gown is too small to cover the robe inside. Mrs.Zhang believes in Buddhism, saying that she reads the \"Goddess of Mercy in White\" ten times a day and asks the Bodhisattva to bless China's army to win. He also said that this Guanyin mantra was very effective. When the war in Shanghai was the most urgent, Mr.Zhang went to work in the Bund and recited the mantra at home. Sure enough, Mr.Zhang had never been hit by a stray bullet.",

Sure enough, Mr.Zhang had never been hit by a stray bullet. Hung-chien thought to himself that he enjoyed the latest western scientific equipment, but he held this belief and sat in the sitting room heated by hot water pipes to recite the Buddha. It can be seen that it is not difficult to \"use western learning as a tool and learn from middle school as a body\". He didn't have much to talk about with Miss Zhang, so he had to ask her what movies she liked. Followed by two guests, both sworn brothers of Mr.Zhang. One is Chen Shiping, a senior employee of European and American tobacco companies. Everyone calls him Z.B., which seems to be the abbreviation of \"there are examples to prove it\" in German. A man named Ding Nasheng, whose foreign name is not poet Tennyson but navy general Nelson, also works for some British shipping company. Mrs.Zhang said that if the number of people can afford a table of mahjong, why not play eight rounds of cards before dinner? Fang Hung-chien's gambling skills are very naive, and he doesn't have much money with him. He doesn't want to take part, so he would rather chat with Miss Zhang. Unable to withstand Mrs.Zhang's repeated encouragement, she had to join the game. Unexpectedly, after four laps, I won more than 100 yuan alone, and my heart moved. I thought that if this luck continued, there would be hope for the otter velvet coat. At this time, he completely forgot the French superstition he told Mr.Sun on the boat, as long as he won money. After eight laps, Fang Hung-chien won nearly 300 yuan. The three people in the same bureau, Mrs.Zhang, \"There are examples to prove it\" and \"Admiral\", stood up and prepared for dinner without paying a penny and saying a word. Hung-chien woke up and said, \"I'm so lucky today! I have never won this much money. \"\r\nMrs.Zhang woke up like a dream and said, \"We are really confused! I haven't settled the account with Mr.Fang yet. Mr.Chen, Mr.Ding, let me pay him alone, and we'll figure it out later. \" He opened the purse and handed the money to Hung-chien at 1510.\r\nI ate western food. \"Admiral\" believes in Christianity, and before sitting down, he winked at the ceiling and thanked God for the meal. Fang Hung-chien was talking and laughing because he won the money. Sitting around smoking and drinking coffee after dinner, he saw a small bookshelf next to the sofa, and guessed that it was all Miss Zhang's reading materials. Besides a lot of West Wind and the original Reader's Digest, there are more than a dozen immortal masterpieces such as The Complete Works of Shakespeare, The Old Testament and the New Testament, Family Layout, a copy of Madame Curie, The Self-study Method of Photography, China and Our People, and movie novels, among which Gone with the Wind is needless to say. [9] A little blue book with a gold title on its back: \"How to gain a Husband and keep him\". Hung-chien couldn't help pulling out a page, only to find a passage saying, \"You should be gentle and sweet to a man in order to leave a good impression in the depths of his heart. Girls, don't forget to always wear a bright smile on your face. \" Seeing this, the smile moved from the book to Hung-chien's face. Look at the written author is a woman, I don't know whether she is married or not. It should be written as \"Mrs.So-and-so\", and this book will see the personal experience and think that the smile is bigger. Looking up, I suddenly saw Miss Zhang pay attention to herself, put the book away and restrained her smile. \"There is an example to prove it.\"",

It should be written as \"Mrs.So-and-so\", and this book will see the personal experience and think that the smile is bigger. Looking up, I suddenly saw Miss Zhang pay attention to herself, put the book away and restrained her smile. \"There is an example to prove it.\" Miss Zhang is asked to play the piano, and everyone agrees. After Miss Zhang finished playing, Hung-chien wanted to remedy this misunderstood smile and was the first to say \"OK\" and begged her to play another song. He sat for a while before leaving the house. Halfway through the rickshaw, he couldn't help laughing when he remembered the title. Husband is a woman's occupation, and no husband means unemployment, so we should firmly hold on to this job. Hum! I don't want women to read that book when I am a rice bowl. I'd rather they look down on me and scold me for nothing. Miss \"I miss you\", we don't have the fate of \"holding a bowl of Qi Mei\". I hope someone with good luck will fall in love with you. Thinking of this, Hung-chien stamped with laughter, took the sky and the moon as Miss Zhang and waved goodbye to her. The foreign coachman suspected that he was drunk, so he told him not to move later, and the car was not easy to pull.\r\nWhen all the guests were dispersed, Mrs.Zhang said, \"This Fang is inappropriate. He is too generous and takes money too seriously. Give me a try and you will show your true colors. At that time, he seemed to be afraid that we would not pay back the debts. Is it ridiculous? \"\r\nMr.Zhang said, \"German goods are always inferior to American goods. What doctor! I have studied in England, and he can't understand a lot of English I speak. After the European War, Germany fell behind. Cars, airplanes, typewriters, cameras, which one is not the latest American design! I don't love European students. \"\r\nMrs.Zhang said, \"Nita, what do you think of this Fang?\"\r\nMiss Zhang couldn't forgive Fang Hung-chien's smile when he was reading a book. She simply said, \"What a nuisance! Look how bad he eats! Nothing like living in a foreign country. When he drinks soup, dip the bread! He ate iron steak chicken, without a knife and fork, and picked the chicken leg with his hand and bit it! I see it all in my eyes. Scare! What kind of courtesy is that? Miss Prym, who teaches social etiquette in our school, will definitely call him piggy wiggy when she sees it! \"\r\nAt that time, the Zhang family's marriage was fruitless, and Mrs.Zhou was rather disappointed. However, when Fang Hung-chien was a child, he read Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin and The Journey to the West, which were not in line with educational principles. He was born too early to be lucky enough to read such good books as Snow White and Pinocchio. He remembers the famous saying in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms: \"A wife is like clothes\", and of course clothes are equal to a wife; He has added a new fur coat now, so he doesn't care about losing his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Kuang!

That spring, the climate was particularly good. This spring spirit stirs people's hearts like gum meat when a baby teets, and it is tickled by a kind of vitality. Shanghai is an outbreak city, and there is no landscape willow as a place to settle in spring. The vegetation in parks and residential gardens, like wild animals in iron cages in zoos, is restrained and lonely, and it is not enough to vent freely in spring. When spring comes, we have to lodge in people's bodies and minds, adding diseases and infections, cases of adultery and drinking and fighting, and pregnant women. The last pile is a good phenomenon, and the wartime population should be supplemented. However, according to Mrs.Zhou, most of the children born this year are ghosts who died in vain, rushing to be reborn and finding the age of their previous lives, for fear that they will not live long in the future.\r\nOver the past few days, Fang Hung-chien has been sleepy during the day and awake at night. I woke up in the morning and heard birds chirping in the trees outside the window. I was happy for no reason and looked forward to it aimlessly. My heart seemed to lose weight and went straight up. But this joy is empty, like a balloon put by a child. It goes up less than a few feet, and then it bursts into nothing, leaving only a sudden nameless disappointment. He fidgeted to move, but he was depressed and unable to exert himself, just like a young flower floating in the spring breeze, but weak and unable to fly far. He realized that this kind of sleepy mood was exactly like the situation in which the secluded boudoir hurt the spring in the lyrics. Now women don't bother to hurt their spring. It's ridiculous that they are wasted as men and can't get rid of such rigid feelings! For example, a woman like Miss Bao never has time to hurt her spring, but what about Miss Su? She is hard to say; She is like a sentimental model of ancient beauty. A farewell on the boat, I wonder how she has been recently. I promised to visit her in the past, so why not go once? Knowing that there may be much trouble from now on, but life is too boring and ready-made girlfriends are too scarce! For example, people who can't sleep, regardless of the harm of sleeping pills, must first figure out the comfort in front of them.\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien arrived at Su's home, Miss Su would have rushed into the living room, laughing and shouting, and scolded herself for not seeing her earlier. The porter brought tea and said, \"Miss will come out.\" The peach blossoms, pear blossoms and lilacs in Su Jiayuan are all in full bloom. Hung-chien thinks it's only the end of February in the lunar calendar, and the flowers have already bloomed early. I wonder what's left for Qingming Spring. A window in the sitting room is open, and the fragrance of flowers baked by the sun is so thick that it is stuffy and warm that people are sleepy. The fragrance of these flowers, like the smell of onion and garlic, is plant-like and fleshy, like being vented from the hair at a summer dance. In the calligraphy and painting hanging on the wall, there is a screen bar written by Shen Zipei and a poem of the Yellow Valley. The first sentence reads: \"The flowers are so fragrant that people want to break the Zen.\" Hung-chien was not far from understanding when he saw it. He felt that the monks had really broken the precepts when they smelled the flowers outside the window, which was almost the same as eating meat.",

He felt that the monks had really broken the precepts when they smelled the flowers outside the window, which was almost the same as eating meat. He read the calligraphy, painting and antiques in the drawing room for three times, thinking that Shen Zipei's foot for writing the word \"human\" was like a little foot wrapped by a big maid in Beiping, with a thick leg like that above, and suddenly a little meal below, and it was over, which was also a foot! Miss Su just came out. Her cold smile, like a cold and snowy day, held hands and said, \"Mr.Fang hasn't seen you for a long time. Why did you come today?\" Hung-chien thought how affectionate it was to hold hands when we parted last year. Holding her hand today is like holding cold-blooded shark fin. It was good when we parted, why did it become so different when we met again? At this time, his psychology was like that of a student cramming for the exam after a night's sleep, and he found that his homework, which he thought was familiar, was still raw, so he had to lie and say that he had come to Shanghai for a few days and had come to visit. Miss Su politely thanked him for \"coming\" and asked him \"where are you proud\". He mumbled something, saying that he didn't find a job yet, but wanted to go to the mainland and help in a bank organized by relatives for the time being. Miss Su glanced at him and said, \"Is it Mr.Fang's family's bank? Mr.Fang, you are so mysterious! When did you have the wedding banquet? We have been classmates for many years, and you have kept it a secret. Did you get a doctor and come back to get married? It's really a gold medal, and it's a double happiness. We won't be lucky enough to visit Mrs.Fang! \"\r\nFang Hung-chien was so ashamed that he remembered the news section of Shanghai Daily and said quickly that it must have come from Shanghai Daily. He berated the Shanghai Daily, and described the reasons of the husband-in-law and the fake doctor with the spring and autumn brushwork. Buying a fake diploma is his own funny play, and recognizing his relatives is his own conformity. He also said: \"When I saw the news, I thought of you first, thinking that you would laugh at me and look down on me. I am still very unhappy with my nominal father-in-law for this matter. \"\r\nMiss Su's face gradually turned and said, \"What's the point? Their vulgar businessmen, of course, only know that they have to pay for the goods, but they don't know that learning doesn't rely on signs. What do you care about with them! That Mr.Zhou is finally your elder, and he has treated you well enough. He has the right to publish that news in the newspaper. Anyway, who will pay attention to that news, and the people who see it will forget it. You have been cynical in big places, and you are serious about the details. The contradiction is ridiculous. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien sincerely admired Miss Su's beautiful speech and replied, \"After telling you this, I won't feel guilty. I should have told you earlier, you are so smart! You said that I couldn't stand the bar, which was especially profound. Great things in the world can be handled casually, but small things can't be borrowed at all. For example, corrupt officials take bribes of tens of millions, but never steal other people's wallets. My humorous attitude is really not thorough. \"\r\nMiss Su wanted to say, \"That's not true. Do not steal the purse because it is not worth stealing; If there are tens of millions in the money bag and it is as safe as taking bribes, he will steal it. \" But she didn't say these words.",
        "43cb3dcf-e3fc-4ce4-b5a4-85a1932fd19b": "You have been cynical in big places, and you are serious about the details.

Do not steal the purse because it is not worth stealing; If there are tens of millions in the money bag and it is as safe as taking bribes, he will steal it. \" But she didn't say these words. She only glanced at Hung-chien and looked at the pattern on the carpet and said, \"It's a pity that your attitude of playing the world is not thorough, otherwise everyone who makes friends with you will be chilling. I'm afraid you will only be perfunctory on your face and laugh at them in your heart.\"\r\nHung-chien was busy exaggerating to guarantee how much he valued friendship. With this conversation, Miss Su told him that her father had gone to Shu with the government and her brother had gone to Hong Kong to work. Only her mother, sister-in-law and her were left in Shanghai, and she wanted to go to the mainland herself. Fang Hung-chien said that maybe they could go the same way again. Miss Su talked about a cousin who studied in their alma mater in Beiping for a year. The university moved inland because of the war. She stopped studying at home for half a year and now plans to resume her studies. This cousin happened to visit the Su family today. Miss Su went in and asked her to come out. She met Hung-chien and will be a travel companion in the future.\r\nMiss Su brought out a petite girl of about twenty and said, \"This is my cousin Tang Xiaofu.\" Miss Tang has a charming and straight round face with two shallow dimples. Born with a good face that ordinary women have to spend money and time, adjust fat and powder to imitate, it is so fresh that people forget their thirst and feel greedy, as if it were good fruit. Her eyes are not big, but they are flexible and gentle, which makes many women's big eyes just like politicians' big talk. Classical scholars will wonder why poets at all times and all over the world are willing to become women's hair pins, waist belts, mats for sleeping, and even shoes and socks trampled under their feet, but they never expect to become her toothbrush. Her hair is not permed, her eyebrows are not tweezers, and her lipstick is not rubbed. It seems that she is at ease to abide by the natural restrictions and not to make up for the defects of nature. In a word, Miss Tang is a rarity in modern civilized society-a real girl. There are many urban girls who are pretentious precocious women and are not children; There are many girls who are just confused and stupid children without sex, not to mention women. Fang Hung-chien immediately wanted to make a good impression on her. Miss Tang respectfully called him an \"old-timer of classmates\", and he protested: \"This can't be done! You call me' senior', and I already feel like the remains of prehistoric hominids. Why did you add the word' old'? Unfortunately, we were born too early and didn't have the blessing to be classmates with you at the same time. This is a pity. You call me' senior' again, which is to remind me that I am an old-fashioned person. It's cruel! \"\r\nMiss Tang said, \"Mr.Fang is really picky! I am wrong, the word' old' is cancelled first. \"\r\nAt the same time, Miss Su said cheerfully, \"Don't be ashamed! Do you want us to call you' Xiao Fang' like those people on board? Xiaofu, don't pay attention to him. He is not flattered, just don't call him anything. \"\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien saw that Miss Tang was not laughing, she still had a smile on her face, like the lingering sound in the air after the music stopped. Many women will smile so sweetly, but their smiles are just facial muscles, as if a coach is shouting a password: \"one!\" \" Suddenly grinning, \"two!\"",
        "bf17b1ec-ee39-4f7a-8613-21100494e133": "This is a pity. You call me' senior' again, which is to remind me that I am an old-fashioned person.

Many women will smile so sweetly, but their smiles are just facial muscles, as if a coach is shouting a password: \"one!\" \" Suddenly grinning, \"two!\" Suddenly I laughed and disappeared, leaving only an empty face, like a curtain before the movie opened. He found something to tell her and asked her what department she entered. Miss Su forbade her to say, saying, \"Let him guess.\"\r\nFang Hung-chien guessed that literature was wrong, education was wrong, and chemistry and physics were all wrong. In the words of Mr.Zhang Jimin, he said, \"Search me! [1] Is it math? That's too much! \"\r\nMiss Tang said that it turned out to be the political department. Miss Su commented, \"That's what matters. The future will be our ruler, female official. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien said, \"Women were born political animals. Virtual reality, retreat for progress, these political skills, women are born with all. Women study politics, which is really the icing on the cake. I was in Europe and attended Mr.Ernst Bergmann's class. He said that men have creative thinking and women have social activities, so what men do in society should be left to women, so men can hide at home and think calmly, invent new science and produce new art. I think this statement is very reasonable. Women don't have to study politics, but politicians nowadays have to learn from women if they want to succeed. The dramas on the political stage are all reversed. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"This is your gentleman's strange theory, and you like that one.\"\r\nFang Hung-chien said, \"Miss Tang, your cousin is really unappreciative. She invited her woman to participate in politics, but she laughed at me for pretending to be strange! You judge it. As the old saying goes, you must put your family in order before you can rule the country and level the world. How many men can manage the housework? The housekeeper depends on women, but he boasts that a gentleman wants to rule the country and level the world, and ignores housework, so he has to build a roof in the air before building a house. Giving all the country and society to women has many advantages, at least it can reduce the war. Diplomacy may be more complicated and there are more secret clauses, but women are not good at fighting because of their physical relationship. Women's minds about machinery are not as good as men's. When they fight or use simple weapons, they even blow their hair, scratch their faces and twist their meat, which is not harmful. In any case, today's modern women have long refused to have more children. By that time, they will be busy with state affairs, and they will have no time to give birth. The population is sparse and the war may not happen at all. \"\r\nMiss Tang felt that Fang Hung-chien said all these things in order to attract his attention. She chuckled and said, \"I don't know if Mr.Fang is insulting politics or women, at least it's not good.\"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Good! I took a turn and kowtowed to others for a long time. Instead of being ungrateful, people didn't understand at all! I advise you to keep your mouth shut. \"\r\nMiss Tang said, \"I'm not ungrateful. I am very grateful that Mr.Fang is willing to perform eloquence for me. If I were studying arithmetic, I think Mr.Fang must have another argument, saying that women are born computational animals. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Maybe someone like you is willing to study math, so he never tires of studying math. Anyway, toss and turn, argue irrationally, all his words. I didn't know he was so glib. This time, returning to China is a vestige.",
        "7fbbaf9f-abc3-4b37-8bee-5ea4f237d300": "She chuckled and said, \"I don't know if Mr.Fang is insulting politics or women, at least it's not good.\"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Good!

Anyway, toss and turn, argue irrationally, all his words. I didn't know he was so glib. This time, returning to China is a vestige. When he was a college classmate, his face turned red when he saw us from a distance, and the closer he got, the redder he became, so red that we were all hot and sad when we looked at it. We call him' thermometer' behind his back, because his face rises and falls suddenly, which shows the distance between him and the female students. It's really fun! I didn't expect that after a trip to a foreign country, I learned such a thick face. Maybe I was trained by a girlfriend like Miss Bao. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien hurriedly said, \"Don't talk nonsense! What are those things for? You female students are really amazing! When you are a prude, you turn your back and dig people to pieces. It's really wicked! \"\r\nMiss Su saw that he was in a hurry. Just now, because his displeasure with Miss Tang had all dissipated, she said with a smile, \"Look at how anxious you are! You're afraid that you won't be sweet-talking to your face and mean to others behind your back. \"\r\nAt this time, a tall and imposing man in his late thirties came in. Miss Tang called him \"Mr.Zhao\" and Miss Su said, \"Well, here you are. I'd like to introduce you: Fang Hung-chien and Zhao Xinmei.\" Zhao Xinmei and Hung-chien held hands and looked at him proudly from head to toe, as if Hung-chien were a kindergarten reader with all the pages at a glance. They asked Miss Su, \"Is it the one who went back to China with you?\"\r\nHung-chien wondered how this Zhao knew about himself, and suddenly thought that maybe this man had read the news in Shanghai Daily and immediately felt embarrassed. Zhao Xinmei was already swaggering. After hearing Miss Su say that Hung-chien really went back to China with her, his expression was as if Hung-chien had turned into thin air and there was no such person in his eyes. If Miss Su doesn't talk to him either, Hung-chien will really feel that he is nothing, like a ghost when the cock crows in the fifth watch, or the truth of Taoism that \"if you don't see it, you can't stand it.\" Miss Su told Hung-chien that Zhao Xinmei and her family are old friends, American students, who used to be the director of the foreign affairs office, but did not move with the agency because of illness, and now they work as political editors in Huamei News Agency. However, she didn't tell Zhao Xinmei about Hung-chien's resume, as if he already knew it and didn't need to say it.\r\nLying on the sofa, with a pipe in his mouth, Zhao Xinmei asked the electric light hanging on the ceiling, \"Where does Mr.Fang work?\"\r\nFang Hung-chien was a little angry.

Zhao Xinmei thought he was smug because of his one-liners and couldn't think of an answer at the moment, so he had to smoke hard. Miss Su held back her laughter and felt a little uneasy. Miss Tang only looked like a fight in the clouds, smiling indifferently. It suddenly dawned on Hung-chien that this Zhao was rude to himself, and he was jealous and regarded himself as his rival in love. Miss Su suddenly changed her name to \"Hung-chien\" instead of \"Mr.Fang\", as if she wanted Zhao to know her intimacy with herself. I think this is the most proud time for all women, watching two men fight for her. Why bother being enemies? Let Zhao Xinmei love Miss Su! Miss Su didn't know Fang Hung-chien's plan. She likes Zhao Fang to fight for herself, but she is worried that the fighting will be too fierce, and the outcome will be decided in an instant. There is only one person left, so there will be no excitement around her. She is more worried that Fang Hung-chien will fail. She borrowed Zhao Xinmei to inspire Fang Hung-chien's courage, but perhaps Fang Hung-chien, as reported in the war news these days, \"kept his strength and made a strategic retreat.\"\r\nZhao Xinmei's father and Su Wenwan's father used to be colleagues, and they shared a house in Beijing in the early Republic of China. Hsin-mei and Miss Su have been playing together since childhood. Mrs.Zhao is pregnant with him, and people think she will have twins. When he was four or five years old, he grew up to be seven or eight years old. Every time an employer took him by tram, he always quarreled with the ticket seller about \"free tickets for children under five years old\". He is a big man with a small heart, like a hollow radish. In primary school, he was the target of classmates' jokes, because there is no reason to stab in the back with such a huge arrow. He and Miss Su's brothers and sisters played a game of \"official beating to catch thieves\". Miss Su and her now married sister and girls could not run fast, but they insisted on being an official or a thief when they picked a thief. Miss Su's brother tried to resist being arrested as a thief, and only he was a good thief who was beaten. Playing with the story of Red Hat, he is always a wolf; When he ate Miss Su's sisters, he just hugged them and made a strange gesture. When the hunter killed the wolf and broke his belly, Miss Su's brother pressed him in the mud to dig his stomach, and once he really cut all his clothes with scissors. Although he has a good temper, his mind is not bad because of it. His father believed in fortune-telling. When he was thirteen or fourteen years old, he took him to see a famous woman fortuneteller. The woman fortuneteller praised him: \"Mars is square, with thick soil shape, high wood sound, bull's eyes, lion's nose, and four-character mouth, which is exactly the phase of the southern nobles as mentioned in the Ma Yi Xiang Fa, and will be famous in the future, far above Laozi.\" From then on, he thought himself a politician. When he was a child, he secretly liked Miss Su. One year, Miss Su was seriously ill. He heard his father say, \"Wen Wan will definitely recover from her illness. She is the fate of the official wife, and she should have helped her husband for 25 years.\" He arbitrarily decided that the husband who should be helped in Miss Su's life was herself, because the physiognomist said that she wanted to be an official.",

She is the fate of the official wife, and she should have helped her husband for 25 years.\" He arbitrarily decided that the husband who should be helped in Miss Su's life was herself, because the physiognomist said that she wanted to be an official. When Miss Su returned to China this time, he wanted to warm up his childhood friendship and propose to her when the time was ripe. When Miss Su first arrived home, all she said was Fang Hung-chien, but suddenly she didn't say anything after the fifth day. The reason was that she saw the old Shanghai Daily and was observant but cautious, and noticed the facts that others had overlooked. Her long-term understanding with Hsin-mei will not become a love affair over time, just like the daily climate in winter. You can't add today's temperature to yesterday's so that tomorrow will become a warm spring day. He is best at speaking in foreign languages, and the loud and fluent American words are like thunder rolling in the sky, greased and waxed, and when he slips, he is halfway up the sky. However, the speech is standing on the stage and condescending; The proposal is short and half-length, begging on your back. Miss Su is not an audience, and Zhao Xinmei has the ability to make it work.\r\nAlthough Zhao Xinmei was jealous of Fang Hung-chien, there was no mortal hatred. His insolence is like Mussolini's and Hitler's attitude when they met with diplomatic representatives of small countries to start negotiations. He wanted to use this dictator's prestige to overwhelm and scare off Hung-chien. Giving Hung-chien a tip, he didn't sound like the slapping table roar of the Italian leader or the fist demonstration of the German head of state. Fortunately, he knew the secret of a diplomat, so he couldn't answer for a while, and used the cigarette in his mouth as a cover. Miss Su asked him how the war was going, so he recited an editorial he had just finished. He still didn't look at Fang Hung-chien, but he was wary of him, just like the attitude of people who sympathized with infectious diseases towards bacteria. Hung-chien was not interested in listening and wanted to talk to Miss Tang, but Miss Tang listened with relish. Hung-chien was going to wait for Miss Tang to leave, so he got up and asked her address when they went out together. When Hsin-mei finished talking about the current situation, he looked at his watch and said, \"It's almost five o'clock now. I'll take a stroll in the newspaper office and come back to pick you up for dinner in Emei Spring. You want to eat Sichuan food. This is the best restaurant in Sichuan. Everyone knows me-Miss Tang, please be sure to show your face-Mr.Fang may as well join in the fun if you are interested. You are very welcome. \"\r\nBefore Miss Su could answer, Miss Tang and Fang Hung-chien both said that it was getting late and it was time to go home. Thanks for Hsin-mei's kindness and thanks for dinner. Miss Su said, \"Sit down for a while, Hung-chien, and I have a few more words to tell you-Hsin-mei, I'm going out with my mother tonight. Shall we eat out another day? At 4: 30 tomorrow afternoon, please all come to tea and accompany Mr.and Mrs.Shen, who have just returned to China. We can talk. \"\r\nZhao Xinmei rushed out when she saw Miss Su keep Fang Hung-chien. Fang Hung-chien stood up and wanted to shake hands with him, so he had to sit down again. \"This Mr.Zhao is really strange! It seems that I have offended him somewhere and hated me in all kinds of words. \"\r\n\"Don't you hate him, too?\" Miss Tang said with a sly smile. Miss Su blushed and scolded her: \"You are the worst!\"",

Miss Su blushed and scolded her: \"You are the worst!\" Hearing this, Fang Hung-chien dared not deny that he hated Zhao Xinmei, so he had to say, \"Miss Su, thank you for the tea party tomorrow. I don't want to come. \"\r\nWithout waiting for Miss Su to speak, Miss Tang said, \"That's impossible! We can not come to the theatre; You are a dramatist, how can you not come? \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Xiao Fu! If you talk nonsense again, I will never talk to you again. You both have to come tomorrow! \"\r\nMiss Tang left by Sujia bus. Hung-chien and Miss Su were opposite each other, trying their best to dilute the words and clear the suffocating air: \"Your cousin has a strong tongue, and she seems to be very clever.\"\r\n\"Although the child is small, she has great skills. She is playing with a boyfriend in her hand!\" Hung-chien's overwhelming disappointment made Miss Su feel sour-\"Don't think she is naive, she is full of ulterior motives! I always thought that a girl who fell in love just after entering college would have no future. You see, mixing with boys, it's so dark that you don't have time to study. Don't you remember Huang Bi and Jiang Meng picked in our class? I don't know where to go now! \"\r\nFang Hung-chien said quickly that he remembered, \"You were very popular at that time, but you had that noble style, and we only dared to admire you from a distance. I really never dreamed that I would be so familiar with you today. \"\r\nMiss Su felt comfortable again. After talking about some old school events, Hung-chien saw that she had nothing important to say to herself, so he said, \"I should go. You have to go out with your aunt tonight.\"\r\nMiss Su said, \"I didn't socialize. That was an excuse, because Hsin-mei was so rude to you that I didn't want to grow his arrogance.\"\r\nHung-chien was frightened and said, \"You are too kind to me!\"\r\nMiss Su glanced at him and lowered her head and said, \"Sometimes I really shouldn't be so kind to you.\" At this time, the air was crawling with the sweet words he should say, and all of them rushed to his mouth to ask him to say. He doesn't want to talk, but he can't be silent. Seeing Miss Su's hand resting on the edge of the sofa, I reached out and patted the back of her hand. Miss Su drew back her hand and said softly, \"Go ahead. Come early tomorrow afternoon. \" Miss Su saw her off at the door of the sitting room. When Hung-chien stepped down, she called \"Hung-chien\". When Hung-chien came back to ask her what she wanted, she said with a smile, \"Nothing. I'm looking at you here. Why do you run straight ahead and never look back? Haha, I'm really unreasonable. I want you to have eyes behind your back-come early tomorrow. \"\r\nWhen Fang Hong gradually left the Su family, he realized that he had become a part of the spring, and he was in cahoots, not a layman in the spring two hours ago. Walking is as light as if the ground is floating. There are only two small things that can't be digested in my heart. First, you shouldn't touch Miss Su's hand at that time. You should pretend not to understand her implication. I am always too soft-hearted, always pandering to women and unwilling to offend them. In the future, I will be more decisive and don't make it a reality. Second, Miss Tang has many boyfriends, and maybe she already has a lover.",

You should pretend not to understand her implication. I am always too soft-hearted, always pandering to women and unwilling to offend them. In the future, I will be more decisive and don't make it a reality. Second, Miss Tang has many boyfriends, and maybe she already has a lover. Hung-chien was so angry that he brutally hit the tree beside the road with his cane. It's better to die before it's too late and be dumped by an underage girl. What a shame! Hoping on the tram in such a disconsolate way, I saw a young man and a young woman talking in love next door. There are a pile of middle school textbooks on the boy's body, and the girls' books are all wrapped in Bao Shu paper photographed by movie stars. The girl is only sixteen or seventeen years old, and her face is made up like a mask made by rubbing oil, picking powder and mixing rouge. Hung-chien thinks that Shanghai deserves to be a civilized and advanced area. Middle school girls have painted the facade to attract men, which is rare in foreign countries. But the girl's face is fake and honest, because no one will believe that the pancake pasted on her face will be her true colors. It suddenly occurred to him that Miss Tang was not very cosmetic. A girl who dresses up deliberately, or an existing boyfriend, has taken a new interest in her body, found new value, or needs a boyfriend, and hangs a bright cover to glare at her eyes so as not to be ignored by men. Miss Tang has no intention of embellishment, which shows that there is no man in her heart. Hung-chien thinks that this conclusion has a profound psychological basis, and combined with strict logical reasoning, it can criticize Q.E.D' s [2] behind his back. He is too happy to sit still. When the tram arrived at the station, he jumped down first without waiting for the bus to stop, and almost fell. Thanks to his cane, his left hand pushed on the pole wood to stop the momentum of jumping to the ground. Scared out in a cold sweat, he wiped off a layer of oil skin on his left palm and gave the tram driver a few words of training. Home palm coated with mercurochrome, he thought it was Tang Xiaofu's own fault, and he would settle accounts with her carefully in the future, smiling from his heart like a bubble and forgetting the pain. He didn't want to wipe off the skin. It was the result of this hand just pressing on Miss Su's hand.\r\nHe will go to Sue's home tomorrow, and Miss Tang has arrived first. Before he could sit down, Zhao Xinmei came, greeted him and said, \"Mr.Fang, he went late yesterday and came early today. I think it is a good habit to work in a bank. I am diligent and admirable! \"\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" Fang Hung-chien wanted to say that Hsin-mei left early yesterday and was late today. On second thoughts, he held back and smiled kindly at Hsin-mei. Hsin-mei didn't expect him to be so unresponsive. Instead, he was scared with a punch. Miss Tang can't hide her surprise. Miss Su was surprised, too, but suddenly realized that this was the winner's generosity. Hung-chien knew that he loved him, so he let Hsin-mei go. Mr.and Mrs.Shen Shi are here. While everyone was introducing greetings, Zhao Xinmei took a sofa of Miss Su recently and sat down. Shen Shi and his wife shared a couch, Miss Tang sat on an embroidered cushion between Miss Su and Mr.Shen's seats, and Hung-chien sat alone near Mrs.Shen. As soon as he sat down, he regretted it, because Mrs.Shen had a smell. Both the elegant address in classical Chinese and the ancient Roman idiom used sheep as a metaphor: \"I'm afraid.\"",

As soon as he sat down, he regretted it, because Mrs.Shen had a smell. Both the elegant address in classical Chinese and the ancient Roman idiom used sheep as a metaphor: \"I'm afraid.\" This warm smell, mixed with the fragrance of powder and flowers, made Fang Hung-chien want to have a stomachache, but he was embarrassed to smoke. I thought it was a woman who had just returned from France, and brought the \"Smelly Symphony\" of the Paris food market to China. I've never met her in Paris, but I can't avoid it today. It can be seen that Paris is big and the world is small. Mrs.Shen looks strange and dresses up like a demon. Two black bags under her eyes, like round-shell marching thermos bottles, are supposed to store passionate tears. The thick rouge on her lips is brought into her mouth by spit, which stains the dark and rugged teeth with red marks. It is bloody like a clue to a murder in a detective novel, and she often speaks \"Tiens!\" \u201cO la\uff0cla\uff01\u201d Those French lamented and twisted their bodies into coquetry and softness. When she moved, the smell added a new breath. Hung-chien wished he couldn't tell her. Just say it with your mouth. Be careful not to twist your body in two. Mr.Shen's lower lip is thick and drooping. At first glance, he knows that he is a person who talks a lot and fast, like a diarrhea in his mouth. He was talking about how he publicized the war to the French and how he won many people's sympathy for China: \"After Nanking retreated, they all said that China was finished. I said to them,' Didn't your government also move its capital to Paris during the European War? But you are the final winners.' They have nothing to say, alas, they have nothing to say. \"Hung-chien thought the government could move the capital, but he couldn't change his seat.\r\nZhao Xinmei said as if he were an expert, \"Good answer! Why don't you do an article? \"\r\n\"Wei Lei recorded this passage of mine in the foreign communication published in Shanghai Daily. Didn't Mr.Zhao see it?\" Mr.Shen asked with a little disappointment.\r\nMrs.Shen leaned forward and waved to her husband. \"Why are you carrying my thing?\" she said with a charming smile. Who will notice! \"\r\nHsin-mei said quickly, \"Yes, yes! I admire it very much. Come to think of it, there is a passage in the communication about moving the capital-\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I didn't see it. What's the title?\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Of course, you philosophers don't read newspapers when they study the problem of overtime. The topic is-hey, it's on my lips, why can't I remember it at the moment? \" He didn't read the newsletter at all, but he didn't want to give up this opportunity to sweep Hung-chien's face.\r\n\"You can't blame him,\" said Miss Su. \"He might have fled and hid in the country at that time, and he couldn't read the newspaper. Hung-chien, isn't it? The title is easy to remember: \"Several Letters to Sisters of the Motherland\", and there is a headline in front of it, which seems to be: \"Qingdao in Europe in Asia\". Mrs.Shen, do I remember correctly? \"\r\nHsin-mei patted his thigh and said, \"Yes, yes, yes! Letters to Sisters of the Motherland, Qingdao in Europe in a Game-writing Game in Asia, the title is very beautiful! Wen Wan, you have a good memory! \"\r\nMrs.Shen said, \"You owe it to you to remember such shameful things. No wonder everyone you know thinks you are a genius. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"You don't need to remember a good thing, it will leave a deep impression.\"",

You are a' brother of the motherland' and you can forgive me for not noticing.\" Mrs.Shen is not young, and her letter is not addressed to \"the niece, niece and grandniece of the motherland\". Miss Tang went to see it and climbed up with her sister instead.\r\nHsin-mei complimented Mrs.Shen to make up for her forgetfulness at that time, and said that Huamei News Agency was going to publish a women's publication and asked her for help. Mr.and Mrs.Shen Shi became more and more intimate with Hsin-mei. The servant pulled open the curtain separating the dining room from the sitting room, and Miss Su invited everyone in to have a snack. Hung-chien was forgiven as a sinner. After eating, he went back to the living room and sat down next to Miss Tang. Mrs.Shen and Zhao Xinmei had a hard time talking. Hsin-mei had a cold and a stuffed nose, so she dared to approach Mrs.Shen. Mr.Shen asked Miss Su questions, meaning that \"Uncle Su\" would find him a place in Hong Kong. Fang Hung-chien realized that his luck had turned for the better today, and he came through all the hardships. He asked Miss Tang in a low voice, \"You didn't eat anything just now, as if you were not feeling well. Are you all right now?\"\r\nMiss Tang said, \"I ate a lot and didn't feel sick!\"\r\n\"I'm not the master, you don't have to be polite to me. I saw you take a sip of soup, so I frowned and fiddled with the spoon and didn't eat anything. \"\r\n\"What's good about eating? Are you embarrassed to keep looking at people? I don't want to show it to you, so I don't eat it. It's your fault-haha, Mr.Fang, don't take it seriously. I didn't know you were watching others eat it. I ask you, when you were sitting next to Mrs.Shen at that time, why didn't you face and keep your mouth shut, as if you were suffering? \"\r\n\"So you are the same!\" Fang Hung-chien and Miss Tang smiled intimately, and they had become friends in need.\r\nMiss Tang said, \"Mr.Fang, I'm a little disappointed to come today-\"\r\n\"disappointed! What do you want? Isn't that taste interesting enough? \"\r\n\"Not that. I thought you and Mr.Zhao must be very lively, but who knows there is nothing. \"\r\n\"I'm sorry, there is no drama to show you. Mr.Zhao misunderstood my relationship with your cousin-maybe you have the same misunderstanding-so I asked him to challenge today, hiding from him and letting him know that I have no conflict of interest with him. \"\r\n\"This is true? As long as the cousin has a statement, isn't this misunderstanding understood? \"\r\n\"Maybe your cousin has her mind. It's better to send a general than a parlour. Unless there is a big enemy at present, Mr.Zhao's skill will not be shown. It's a pity that we, the weak and beaten army, don't fight, and don't want to fight-\"\r\n\"Why not be a volunteer?\"\r\n\"No, it's just a teacher.\" As he spoke, Fang Hung-chien was also annoyed that this remark was so frivolous that Miss Tang could not tell Miss Su.\r\n\"However, the defeated often get more sympathy from others-\"Miss Tang thought this would cause misunderstanding and blushed-\"I mean, my cousin may be sponsoring the weak ethnic groups.\"\r\nHung-chien was so happy that his heart jumped less. \"Then I can't care less.",

Miss Tang, I'd like to invite you to have dinner with your cousin tomorrow, just in Emei Spring. Will you come? \" Miss Tang hesitated before agreeing. Hung-chien continued, \"I know I'm bold and presumptuous. Your cousin says that you have a lot of friends, and I don't deserve it, but I really want to make a sum of them. \"\r\n\"I don't have any friends. My cousin is talking nonsense-what did she tell you?\"\r\n\"She didn't say anything. She only said that you are sociable and know many people.\"\r\n\"This is too strange! I am the country girl who has never seen the world. \"\r\n\"Don't mention it, I beg you to come tomorrow. I want to eat, and I have no good excuse for myself. In the name of you two, enjoy yourself. Just be considerate and agree! \"\r\nMiss Tang said with a smile, \"Mr.Fang, what you say is full of articles. In this case, I will come. What time will it be tomorrow night? \"\r\nHung-chien told her the time, and she was physically and mentally Shu Tai. She only heard Mrs.Shen Lang Lang say, \"When I attended the World Conference on Women this time, I observed a general trend: women all over the world now tend to be male-\"Hung-chien was surprised and laughed, thinking that this was the truth from ancient times, and Mrs.Shen should not have learned it until now when she attended the Women's Conference-\"The occupations that men used to do, such as parliamentarians, lawyers, newspaper reporters, pilots and so on. A Yugoslav female sociologist gave a speech at the conference, saying that apart from some women who are willing to be good wives and mothers, other professional women can be called' the third sex'. Women's liberation is still a recent fact, but it has made such remarkable achievements. I dare say that in the near future, the difference between men and women will become a noun in history. \" Zhao Xinmei said, \"Mrs.Shen, you are right. Women nowadays are really capable! Wen Wan, like Xu Baoqiong and Miss Xu, does Mrs.Shen know her? She helped her father run the dairy, and she handled all the big and small things. She was gentle and weak, and she couldn't see it! \" When Hung-chien had a word with Miss Tang, Miss Tang couldn't help laughing. Miss Su was originally saying, \"Baoqiong is smarter than her father, and she is simply a manager who doesn't show up at the dairy.\" She didn't like the close relationship between Hung-chien and Miss Tang, because she said, \"Xiaofu, what's so happy about?\"\r\nMiss Tang shook her head and just laughed. Miss Su said, \"Hung-chien, let's hear a joke.\"\r\nHung-chien shook his head and said nothing, which made it even more obvious that he and Miss Tang shared a secret equally, and Miss Su was very unhappy. Zhao Xinmei made his most successful contemptuous expression and said, \"Maybe the philosopher Fang Da was explaining the optimism in the philosophy of life, so Miss Tang listened so happily.

If you have horns on your head, you will become a cow. How can you show that you are the manager of the dairy!\" Say that finish, finding laughter. He thought that Fang Hung-chien was telling himself again, and thought that he had to make persistent efforts today and never quit first. He lingered until Fang left, so he sat more deeply on the sofa. Fang Hung-chien's purpose has been achieved, and he doesn't want to stay. It's easier to say goodbye to Miss Su because there are many people. Miss Su sent Hung-chien to the corridor because he didn't get close to himself today. It was like going out in cold weather and baking his hands in front of the stove before leaving.\r\nHung-chien said, \"Miss Su, I didn't have a chance to talk to you more today. Are you free tomorrow night? I'd like to invite you to dinner, just in Emei Spring. I don't want Zhao Xinmei to invite me! I just hate that I can't compare with him as an old customer, and the food may not be as good as he can order. \"\r\nMiss Su was relieved to hear that he was still angry with Zhao Xinmei and said with a smile, \"Good! Just the two of us? \" I'm a little shy about asking, and I think it's unnecessary to ask.\r\n\"No, there's your cousin,\" said Fang Hung-chien.\r\n\"Oh, have her. Have you invited her? \"\r\n\"I invited her, and she promised to come-to accompany you.\"\r\n\"Well, goodbye.\"\r\nMiss Su's parting attitude chilled Fang Hung-chien's happiness. He thought it was impossible to do both things, and he just wanted to do it smoothly and cleanly, so that Miss Su's love would end well. He sighed and pitied Miss Su. I don't love her, but I am soft-hearted for her. This is so unfair! She's so tricky! She shouldn't get hurt so easily. She should hold on and not feel pain. Why does love reduce the resistance of a person's mind and make people weak and be pushed around? If God really loves human beings, he has no power to be the master. If Zhao Hsin-mei knew about Fang Hung-chien's idea, he would be scolded as a \"philosopher\". His sleep that night was like the lines of japonica rice powder, which was not sticky and could not last long. His happiness came out of his sleep and made him wake up four or five times. Every time he woke up, it was like Tang Xiaofu's face in front of his eyes and his voice in his ears. When he talked to her today, he pressed his heart against his every move, fell asleep in a daze, and then woke up, feeling that this happiness was buried in sleep, holding back his sleep and warming up the scene of the day again. Finally, I woke up and got up. It was a tender cloudy day. He thought it was not safe to choose this treat day, and he wished he could dry up the faint water clouds in the sky with blotting paper. Today is Monday, as usual, a busy day in the bank. He didn't get off the office until six o'clock in the afternoon, so he didn't have time to go home and change clothes before going out, so he dressed up before going out in the morning. Imagine yourself as Miss Tang, examining her appearance in the mirror with her eyes. Less than a year after returning to China, I have added many wrinkles on my forehead. I didn't sleep well yesterday, and my face and eyes are bleak. After he found a lover in the past two days, he knew his shortcomings in appearance in detail, as if only the poor man in a set of foreign clothes knew every stain and patch on it.",

In fact, to others, his face looks as usual, but he thinks it's particularly ugly today. He changed his tie three times before going down for breakfast. Mr.Zhou still doesn't get up at this time every day, and only he, Mrs.Zhou and Xiao Cheng are eating. When he was about to finish eating, the telephone rang upstairs, which was installed outside his bedroom, so he couldn't be quiet at home. He often heard upset, thinking that his fiancee had given her life to the \"stolen soul bell\" of this phone. At this time, the female servant came down and said, \"Master Fang's phone number is Su, a woman.\" As the maid spoke, the news in her eyes with Mrs.Zhou and Xiao Cheng was so busy that it could mark the spring water in the air. Hung-chien didn't expect Miss Su to call. Mrs.Zhou was determined to ask questions. She went up to answer them in three steps and two steps, only to hear Xiao Cheng loudly say, \"I guess it's Su Wenwan.\" The child mistook \"Aisingiorro\" as \"Dear Paul\" in the national history class the day before yesterday, and gave the teacher a good scolding. He was so angry that he stayed at home today, but he never forgot Miss Su's name.\r\nHung-chien picked up the receiver and felt that the whole Zhou family was listening with bated breath. \"Where's Miss Su?\" he whispered. I'm hung-chien. \"\r\n\"Hung-chien, I don't think you can go out at this time, so I'll give you a call. I'm not feeling well today. I can't go to Emei Spring tonight. I'm very sorry! Don't scold me. \"\r\n\"Will Miss Tang go?\" Hung-chien regretted what he said.\r\nCategorically: \"I don't know.\" Distant again: \"She will go naturally!\"\r\n\"What's wrong with you? Is it serious?\" Hung-chien knew it was too late to ask.\r\n\"Nothing, I feel tired and lazy to go out.\" The meaning is obvious.\r\n\"I'm relieved. Take a good rest, I will definitely come to see you tomorrow. What do you like to eat? \"\r\n\"Thank you, I don't want anything-\"Have a meal-\"See you tomorrow then.\"\r\nIt was only when Miss Su hung up that Hung-chien remembered that he should politely cancel today's dinner and treat him another day. Do you want to call Miss Su again and ask her to tell Miss Tang that dinner has been rescheduled? But I really don't want to. While thinking about it, Xiao Cheng jumped and ran, screaming all the way up and saying, \"Dear Miss Missu, are you lovesick?\" What do you like to eat?' I like to eat big cakes, fried dough sticks, spiced beans, dried nose and smelly salty fish'-\"Hung-chien stopped with a drink and cut off the food list he opened on his behalf, scaring him into begging for mercy. Hung-chien punched him lightly, let him go, and went down to have breakfast. Mrs.Zhou really waited for him, questioned him carefully, and said, \"Don't forget to worship me as a foster mother.\" Hung-chien said quickly, \"I'm waiting for you to dry your daughter. Take a few more and choose some. This Miss Su is just my old classmate, and it doesn't matter. Don't worry. \"\r\nThe weather is getting sunny, and Fang Hung-chien's interest is greatly reduced because of the phone call in the morning. He feels that such a good day can't bear it, as if the tent is about to collapse. Miss Su is undoubtedly making trouble.",

He feels that such a good day can't bear it, as if the tent is about to collapse. Miss Su is undoubtedly making trouble. It would be better if she didn't come, leaving only herself and Miss Tang. But there is no third party. Will Miss Tang come? I didn't ask her for her address and telephone number yesterday, so I can't ask her if she knows if Miss Su will not come tonight. Miss Su will definitely inform her. What if she asks Miss Su to tell her that she won't come? That would be terrible! He was in charge of the paperwork for Director Wang in the bank. Today, he was full of worries. There were several mistakes in the draft letter. Director Wang started to correct it for him. He laughed and said, \"Brother Hung-chien, our husband has a good eye for things!\" By six o'clock, there was no news from Miss Tang. He panicked and was afraid to call Miss Su. At about seven o'clock, a person strolled to Emei Spring disgruntled, asked for a room, and prepared to wait for it for an hour and a half. When Miss Tang didn't come, she had to eat alone. Although he waited patiently, he dared not hope. Lit a cigarette and put it out again; It's not cool to open the window wide at night, for fear of the smell of smoke all over the house, which Miss Tang doesn't like to smell. He opened the book he took to the bank to read, knowing every word, and none of it made sense. Hearing the voice of the waiter greeting the guests outside, my heart lifted straight. It's about 7: 30, and it's only 7: 40 by the watch. It's never going to arrive at this time-suddenly the curtain was opened, and the waiter stood by and came in. Hung-chien was not happy, but grateful. After greeting, he said, \"It's a wet blanket. Miss Su can't come today.\"\r\n\"I know. I was too lucky to come, and I couldn't get through to you. \"\r\n\"I thank the telephone company, I hope it is well-developed, and the wires are too busy to get through this temporary change of phone. Did you call the bank? \"\r\n\"No, to your house. Here's the thing. My cousin called early in the morning to say that she would not come to dinner today, and she has already informed you. I said I wouldn't come either. She asked me to tell you myself and told me your phone number. I shook the phone and asked,' Is it Fang Mansion?' A woman's voice said in your hometown-alas, I can't learn-and said,' This is the Zhou Mansion, and only one Fang lives here. Are you Miss Su, looking for Fang Hung-chien? Hung-chien is out. When he comes back, I'll ask him to call you. Miss Su, come and play in the shed when you are free. Hung-chien often talks about your talent and beauty-I can't get in a word if I go on talking at once. I thought the mystery soup was poured into the wrong ear, so I hung up the receiver. Who's this one? \"\r\n\"This is my relative Mrs.Zhou, the general manager of our bank. Your cousin called just before I went out, so Mrs.Zhou thought it was her again. \"\r\n\"Oh, no! She must blame my cousin for being rude. I hung up the receiver for less than five minutes when my cousin called again and asked if I had told you. When I said you weren't at home, she told me the phone number in your bank again. I think you might still be on the road at that time, so just call back later. Who knows that fifteen minutes later, my cousin called for the third time, and I was a little angry. She knew I hadn't talked to you yet, and urged me to call quickly, saying that you hadn't made a reservation before it was too late, so I said I would go to eat when I made a reservation.",

What's the big deal? She said it was not good and asked me to go to her house for dinner. I told her that I wasn't feeling well either, and I wasn't going anywhere. Think about it later, cousin is ridiculous! I came to eat your meal, so I didn't call. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Miss Tang, you've really saved the day, not only to save face. I can't thank you enough for being the host. I will invite you more times in the future. If none of the invited guests come, it will be tantamount to the host being sentenced to death in social life. Today is a close call! \"\r\nFang Hung-chien ordered food for five or six people. Miss Tang asked if there were any guests nearby and how they could eat so many things. Fang Hung-chien said that there were not many dishes. Miss Tang said, \"You saw that I didn't eat snacks yesterday. Are you going to test whether I eat or not today?\"\r\nKnowing that she was not a woman pretending to be charming, Hung-chien closed her mouth as small as the bottle of an eye drop at the party and replied, \"This is the first time I have eaten in this restaurant, and I am not sure what dishes best suit my appetite. Try a little more, try a wider range, so it's not delicious, and there's another one that won't make you hungry. \"\r\n\"This is not eating vegetables, it's like Shennong tasting a hundred herbs. Not too wasteful? Maybe all men like to waste in front of strange women. \"\r\n\"Maybe, but not in front of all strange women.\"\r\n\"Only in front of stupid women, right?\"\r\n\"I don't understand this.\"\r\n\"Women are not stupid and never have a good impression on men because they are wasteful and ostentatious-but don't worry, women are all stupid, just as men want them to be, no more, no less.\"\r\nHung-chien didn't know whether these words were due to her innocence and frankness or her cousin's so-called cunning. When the food arrived and they were eating, Hung-chien asked her for her address and asked her to write it on the back page of the book she was reading, because he never liked to bring a notebook. Seeing that she had written down the phone number, he said, \"I will never call you.\" I hate talking on the phone between friends, and I would rather write letters. \"\r\nMiss Tang: \"Yes, I feel the same way. Being friends should love to meet each other; I've been in contact with you by phone, but I haven't seen you in person, and I can't keep what I said for several times like a letter. Telephone is the visit of lazy people, the communication of stingy people, and the least friend! Besides, have you noticed? A person's voice often becomes unrecognizable and ugly on the phone. \"\r\n\"Miss Tang, you have a good time. I live in Zhoujia, and there is a phone at the door of the house, which makes me have a headache every day. Often at the most unreasonable time, like midnight and early morning, there are calls. What a nuisance! Fortunately,' TV' is not widely used, otherwise it will be even worse. You have people in the bathtub and under the covers to have a peek. The more popular education is, the fewer people write letters; It's not a business priority. People are still afraid of writing letters and prefer to call. I think this is because writing letters is easy to make a fool of yourself, and people with high status and decent speeches often can't move their pens.",

However, the telephone can save the visit of those who look disgusting, and writing letters from those who are ignorant of arts and sciences can be regarded as an invention with infinite merits. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien talked happily and tried to persuade Miss Tang to eat, but he ate very little himself. It was only nine o'clock after eating the fruit, and Miss Tang was leaving. Hung-chien dared not keep her, so he paid the bill and called the waiter to put a car in the car shop to let Miss Tang go home. He told her that he promised Miss Su to visit the doctor tomorrow and asked her if she would go. She said that she might go, but she didn't believe that Miss Su was really ill. Hung-chien said, \"Should we tell her about our dinner?\"\r\n\"Why don't you tell her? No, no, I just lost my temper and told her I wouldn't go anywhere today. Ok, whatever you think. Anyway, you have to go to the bank office, and I will go later. \"\r\n\"I want to visit the house the day after tomorrow, won't I refuse to receive a call?\"\r\n\"Very welcome, only the room is very cramped, not as big as my cousin's big garden house. You are not too humble, just come. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Can you meet the old man?\"\r\nMiss Tang said with a smile, \"Unless you have legal questions to ask him, and he is always in his law office, he won't come back until late. Mom and dad have absolute trust in my sisters, never interfere or test our friends. \"\r\nAs he spoke, the bus came and Hung-chien walked her on. On the train home, I thought today was an unexpected success, but Miss Tang's words \"our friends\" made him sour and jealous, and there were a large group of big boys around Miss Tang.\r\nWhen Miss Tang came home, her parents teased her and said, \"The social star is back!\" \" She went back to her room and was changing clothes when the maid came to say that Miss Su called. Miss Tang went down to pick it up, and when she got halfway up the stairs, she changed her mind and couldn't go on. She sent the servant to reply, \"Miss didn't feel well and went to bed early.\" Miss Tang thought angrily, this must be my cousin to find out if she is at home. She is such a bully! Fang Hung-chien isn't hers, so she should take care of him like this? The more cousin intervenes in this way, the more she favors him. I will never love Fang Hung-chien. Love is a tortuous and great emotion, and it is by no means so easy and simple. If you fall in love with someone in this way, then love is so easy that you don't believe it, so easy that you don't believe it.\r\nTomorrow afternoon, Hung-chien bought some flowers and fruits and came to Sue's house. When he saw Miss Su, he took the lead and shouted, \"What happened yesterday? You are sick, she is sick, and this disease is contagious? Or are you afraid of poison in my treat? I am so angry that I am half dead! I went to eat alone, and I didn't care if you didn't come. Well, well, I finally got to know you two big shelf ladies, and I won't dare to hit a nail in the future. \"\r\nMiss Su said apologetically, \"I'm really ill. I won't be able to call you until the second half of the day. I'm afraid you'll blame me for joking with you. When I informed Xiao Fu yesterday, I didn't ask her not to go. Let me call her now and ask her to come over. It's all my fault this time.",

I'll be the host next time. \" He called Miss Tang to ask if she was well, and asked her to come, saying that Hung-chien was also here. After the phone call, Miss Su held the flowers sent by Hung-chien and sniffed them. She asked the servant to put them in a bottle in the bedroom and asked Hung-chien later, \"Do you know a Cao Yuanlang in England?\" Hung-chien shook his head. \"-he studied literature in Cambridge, is a new poet, recently returned to China. His family is friends with us. He came to see me yesterday and will come again today. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Good! No wonder we lost face yesterday. We went to talk about poetry. We are vulgar! I don't deserve to know you. That Mr.Cao was born in Cambridge. How can we be qualified to make friends with him if we have a name in a later university? Let me ask you, it seems that he is not mentioned in your Eighteen Vernacular Poets. Are you going to add him when you reprint it? \"\r\nMiss Su seems to be angry and laughing, and her left index finger points at him in the air: \"You are jealous and eat irrelevant vinegar.\" Her expression and meaning scared Fang Hung-chien to dare not speak, only regretting that he was too angry to pretend. After a while, Miss Tang came. Miss Su said, \"What a shelf! I called to greet you last night, and you didn't call back today. At this time, I have to be invited again. Mr.Fang is asking about you. \"\r\nMiss Tang said, \"Do we have shelves? We are called around by others. What's strange about coming even if you are invited? If you refuse to go after being invited, it will be great! \"\r\nMiss Su was afraid that she would tell about the three phone calls she made yesterday. She quickly hooked her waist and comforted her, saying, \"Look at you, kid, you have to be serious when you tell a joke.\" So he peeled an orange from Hung-chien and ate it with her. The porter brought in a round-faced man and said, \"Mr.Cao.\" Hung-chien was startled and wondered how the child of Mrs.Sun, who returned to China in the same boat last year, had grown so big that he was called \"Brother Sun\" by accident. There are such similar faces in the world! It seems that people who write poetry should not be fat, and poetry is afraid that it will not be good. Suddenly, I remembered that Jia Dao, a famous cold and thin poet in the Tang Dynasty, was also short and round, but Cao Yuanlang was not a judge by his appearance. After the introduction and greeting, Cao Yuanlang took out a mahogany splint from his briefcase and solemnly handed it to Miss Su, saying, \"I brought it for advice today.\" Only then did Hung-chien realize that it was not a law post, but a manual of rice paper framed with refined coir in Rong Baozhai. Miss Su took it, rummaged it and said, \"Mr.Cao, let me keep it for a closer look and return it next week, okay?\" -Hung-chien, haven't you read Mr.Cao's masterpiece? \"\r\nHung-chien was thinking about what good poems should be recorded in such an exquisite book. He respectfully held it over, opened it and saw the words written by the brush. The title of the first sonnet was \"A companion to the platter\", and the word \"one\" was noted below.",

He respectfully held it over, opened it and saw the words written by the brush. The title of the first sonnet was \"A companion to the platter\", and the word \"one\" was noted below. After careful study, he found that there was an author's note on the second page, and this \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" and \"four\" were the order of the note. The note \"One\" is: \"M\u00e9 lange Abult\u00e9 re\" [3]. This poem goes together:\r\nLast night and tonight, the stars are swaying in the wind that floats to tomorrow night (2)\r\nA plump and white pregnant woman's belly quivers and sticks to the sky (3)\r\nWhen did this runaway woman from grass widow get a new husband? (4)\r\n\u3000\u3000Jug\uff01 Jug\uff01 (5) in the sludge-efango\u00e8 ilmondo! (6)-The nightingale sings [4] (7) ...\r\nHung-chien jumped to see the last couplet:\r\nOn the summer night after the rain, the land is full and clean, and the land is fat and new.\r\nThe smallest grass takes part in the silent cry: \"Wir sind!\" \" [5] (30)\r\nAfter the poem, the source of the words is carefully noted, and there are poems by Li Yishan, T.S.Eliot, Tristan Corbi\u00e9 re, Leopardi and Franz Werfel. Hung-chien only noticed that \"pregnant woman's belly\" refers to the full moon, \"runaway woman\" refers to Chang 'e, and \"nightingale in the mud\" refers to frog. He didn't have the stomach to read it any more, so he put the manuscript on the coffee table and said, \"It's really wordless and has no origin, which is almost the same as what people who write old poems call' poems of scholars'.\" Is this style neoclassical? \"\r\nCao Yuanlang nodded and said the English word \"neoclassical\". Miss Su asked what it was, so she read \"A Companion to a Mixed Dish\" and said, \"This topic is clever enough. A knot is especially good; The words' silent cry' really convey the vitality of summer foolishness and anger. Tout y fourmille de vie[6], thanks to Mr.Cao. \" When the poet heard this, he was so happy that his fat face was covered with butter. Hung-chien suddenly had a terrible suspicion that Miss Su was a fool or a liar. Miss Tang also read the poem and said, \"Mr.Cao, you are too cruel to our uneducated readers.\" I don't know any foreign words in the poem. \"\r\nCao Yuanlang said, \"The style of my poem is more appreciated by people who don't know foreign characters. The topic is the meaning of mixed words and eighteen words. You only need to look at the words of this person and that person, and there are western languages in Chinese. Naturally, there is an impression of mixed words. Miss Tang, you appreciate this complicated impression, don't you? \" Miss Tang had to nod. The smile marks on Cao Yuanlang's face are like the water that has been thrown with stones. He said, \"That is to grasp the essence of this poem, and there is no need to seek the meaning of it. It is unfortunate that poetry is meaningful! \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"I'm sorry. Sit down for a while. I'll show you something.\" Miss Su turned her back. Hung-chien said, \"Mr.Cao, when Miss Su's eighteen vernacular poets is reprinted, you will definitely be added to the list of nineteen.\"\r\n\"No way,\" said Cao Yuanlang. \"I'm too different from them to get along. Yesterday, Miss Su told me that she wrote that book to get a degree, but in fact she didn't think highly of their poems. \"\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\"Mr.Fang, have you read that book?\"\r\n\"I have forgotten it.\"",

The barber told him that he didn't have to cut his hair. After a few days, all his hair fell out. Most modern literature is equally unworthy of criticism. This metaphor is quite playful. \"\r\nHung-chien had to say, \"I didn't notice.\" I want to lose myself by not marrying Miss Su, or I should read Miss Su's book so well. It's a pity that Zhao Xinmei doesn't know enough French to read books. If he wants to be like Cao Yuanlang, he will definitely win the favor of Miss Su.\r\nMiss Tang said, \"The poet mentioned in my cousin's book is eighteen hairs. In the future, Mr.Cao will be like the hair of a miser.\"\r\nEveryone laughed. Miss Su brought in a rosewood fan box and winked at Miss Tang, who smiled and nodded. Miss Su pulled open the lid of the box, took out a female folding fan carved with agarwood bones and handed it to Cao Yuanlang. \"There is a poem on it, please have a look.\"\r\nYuen Long spread out his fan and read it aloud, sounding like a monk giving food and a player speaking plainly. Hung-chien didn't hear a word, because people hum poems and talk in a dying voice, both of which use local accent. After Yuan Long recited the poem, he recited it silently like a cat, flipping his lips and saying, \"OK, OK! Simple and sincere, with the flavor of ancient folk songs. \"\r\nMiss Su seemed coy and said, \"Mr.Cao has a good eye. Honestly, is that poem passable?\"\r\nAt the same time, Fang Hung-chien took the fan from Cao Yuanlang, and when he saw it, he was evil in his heart. On the good flying gold sector, it is written with a purple ink pen obliquely-\r\nDo I imprison you?\r\nOr are you hogging me?\r\nYou broke into my heart,\r\nClose the door and twist the lock.\r\nLost the key to the lock,\r\nIt's me, maybe yourself.\r\nUnable to open the door from now on,\r\nForever, you are locked in my heart.\r\nThe small print after the poem is: \"In the autumn of 26 years of the Republic of China, I recorded an old work for Miss Wen Wan. Wang Erkai. \" This Wang Erkai is a famous young politician, and he is a modest official in Chongqing. The two ladies looked at Fang Hung-chien expectantly. He put down his fan and pouted, \"You should clap your hands when you write this kind of word! I have never seen a folding fan written with a pen, but he doesn't write a paragraph in a foreign language! \"\r\nMiss Su said quickly, \"Don't worry about the quality of the handwriting. What do you think of the poem?\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Can a man as keen as Wang Erkai as an official still write a good poem? I don't ask him for a job, and I have no obligation to compliment bad poems. \" He didn't notice Miss Tang frowning and shaking her head.\r\nMiss Su said angrily, \"You are the most annoying person, full of prejudice, and you are not worthy to speak poetry at all.\" Put the fan away.\r\nHung-chien said, \"OK, OK, let me watch it again calmly.\" Although Miss Su pouted and said, \"I don't want you to watch it,\" she still asked Hung-chien to take the fan. Hung-chien suddenly pointed to the poem on the fan and shouted, \"Great!",
        "8aaf4e2c-bd39-4b30-9689-626f255185cb": "Miss Su said quickly, \"Don't worry about the quality of the handwriting.

Hung-chien suddenly pointed to the poem on the fan and shouted, \"Great! This poem was stolen. \"\r\nMiss Su's face was livid and said, \"Don't talk nonsense! How is it stolen? \" Miss Tang also opened her eyes wide.\r\n\"At least borrowed, borrowed foreign debt. Mr.Cao said that it has the flavor of ancient folk songs, which is exactly right. Miss Su, do you remember? We heard Mr.Wang talk about this poem in the class of European literature history. This is a German folk song in the 15th and 16th centuries. Before I went to Germany, I studied German with someone, and I read it again in a primer. At the beginning, I said,' I am yours, you are mine,' and at the end, I said to the effect,' You are closed, in my heart; The key is lost and can never be taken out. \" I can't remember the original words, but the meaning will never be wrong. There is no such coincidence in the world. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"I don't remember saying this poem in the class of European literature history.\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Why not? Maybe you didn't pay attention in class, and you didn't record everything as I did. This can't be blamed on you. You are studying in your department, and not taking notes only means that you are good at learning. You all know what Mr.Wang said. We are from the China Literature Department. If we don't write in class, we will give you a bad laugh, don't understand, and can't take notes. \"\r\nMiss Su could not speak, and Miss Tang lowered her head. Cao Yuanlang expected that Fang Hung-chien knew German almost like himself, and he was a student of China Literature Department, and he was even less brilliant-because in college, science students looked down upon liberal arts students, foreign language students looked down upon China Literature students, China Literature students looked down upon philosophy students, philosophy students looked down upon sociology students, sociology students looked down upon education students, and education students had no one to look down upon but their husbands. Cao Yuanlang suddenly said boldly, \"I also know that this poem has a history. Didn't I say something about the style of ancient folk songs earlier? However, Mr.Fang's attitude completely violates the spirit of literary appreciation. You China literature, all have the bad habit of \"textual criticism\". Poems have been published, and when they are read by people who know the goods, the more they feel rich in flavor. Reading a poem is associated with countless poems to set off the clouds. Mr.Fang, you should read the poems that love interests and hate virtues, and you will know that the things of modern western poets have their origins, but we don't say that they copied them. Miss Su, right? \"\r\nFang Hung-chien wished he could say, \"No wonder your masterpiece is like that, many-hued. You insiders are not surprised, but we laymen have to report the arrest of thieves. \" He just smiled at Miss Su and said, \"Don't be a wet blanket. Few things given to women are really their own, and when they are exposed, they are all flowers to offer Buddha. If the giver is an official, let alone the gift is exploited from others. \" Say, wonder why Miss Tang didn't pay much attention.\r\nMiss Su said, \"I don't want to hear your sarcastic remarks. Fang Hung-chien is the only smart person in the world! \"\r\nHung-chien sat down for a while, and seeing that everyone was not interested in talking, he took leave and left first, and Miss Su didn't leave him. After he went out, he was restless, knowing that what he said today offended Miss Su. Then Wang Erkai must be another admirer of hers.",

After he went out, he was restless, knowing that what he said today offended Miss Su. Then Wang Erkai must be another admirer of hers. But he was so excited that he forgot everything when he thought that tomorrow was the day to visit Miss Tang.\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien arrives at the Tang family tomorrow, Miss Tang teaches the maid to invite him to sit in his father's study. After meeting, he said, \"Mr.Fang, you made a big disaster yesterday, do you know?\"\r\nFang Hung-chien thought for a moment and said with a smile, \"Is it because I criticized that poem that your cousin is angry with me?\"\r\n\"Do you know who wrote that poem?\" Seeing Fang Hung-chien's stare, she still didn't understand-\"That poem was written by my cousin, not by Wang Erkai.\"\r\nHung-chien jumped up and said, \"Yeah? Don't kid me, isn't it clearly written on the fan' Recording old works for Miss Wen Wan'? \"\r\n\"What is recorded is Miss Wen Wan's old work. Wang Erkai has contacts with his cousin, and he is also Zhao Xinmei's boss, and he has a wife at home. But when his cousin returned to China last year, he kept trying to please him, which made Zhao Xinmei lose weight. Theoretically, people should be fatter because of the atmosphere in their stomachs, don't you think so? Later, the administrative organs moved into the mainland, and he was so eager to be an official that he left his cousin and went inside. This is also the reason why Zhao Xinmei refused to go to the mainland. He gave this fan to his cousin, and he specially invited someone to carve the pattern on the fan bone. That poem is still my cousin's favorite work. \"\r\n\"This unreasonable boring politician, the money on the fan is going astray, which has caused me to go wrong, damn it! What should I do? \"\r\n\"What should I do? Fortunately, Mr.Fang is eloquent, and it only takes a few words to explain. \"\r\nHung-chien was praised, proud and humble, and said, \"It's a terrible thing. I'm afraid it won't be easy. I'll write a letter to your cousin and apologize to her. \"\r\n\"I'd like to know how to write this letter, so that I can learn it well, and maybe I can use it in the future.\"\r\n\"If this letter has a good effect, I will copy it to you. Did they scold me after I left yesterday? \"\r\n\"The poet said a lot of things, but my cousin didn't say anything, and said that your Chinese is very good. The poet quoted one of his friends as saying that modern people must study foreign literature if they want to learn Chinese well. Those who used to engage in western science should know foreign languages, and those who engage in China literature should master foreign languages first. That friend heard that he will return to China soon, and Cao Yuanlang will bring him to see his cousin. \"\r\n\"It is a baby! Those who make friends with that poet have no good goods. Look at his song \"A Companion to a Mixed platter\", it's almost incomprehensible. Moreover, he is not honest, he is bullying others, and he has no fear of being unreasonable. \"\r\n\"We are naive and unworthy to speak. However, I don't think people who study in famous foreign universities are as bad as you say. Maybe his poem was meant to be a joke. \"\r\n\"Miss Tang, studying abroad now is the same as the imperial examination fame of Qing Dynasty. My father used to say that once upon a time, people missed the Jinshi, and how big your officer did it, he always held lifelong regrets. You can also get rid of this inferiority complex by staying in school, not for advanced knowledge. Going abroad is like getting pimples and prickles. You have to go abroad.",

Our souls are sound, and we have the resistance to defend ourselves when we meet these microscopic worms, doctors and masters. When the pox is over, we forget about it; Those who have studied abroad should also say that they have forgotten about studying abroad. People like Cao Yuanlang are obsessed with being international students, hanging the guise of Oxford and Cambridge everywhere, just like being willing to become pockmarked with smallpox, and proud that their faces are like good articles with dense circles. \"\r\nMiss Tang said with a smile, \"After listening to you, people only say that you are jealous that the university they entered is more famous than yours.\"\r\nHung-chien couldn't think of anything to answer, so he smirked at her. She would rather he could not answer sometimes and asked him, \"I was a little surprised yesterday, how could you not know that the poem was written by my cousin?\" You should have read her poems. \"\r\n\"Your cousin and I are familiar with each other on the home ship this time, and the time is very short. We haven't talked about it before. Do you remember the day she said that my nickname at school was' thermometer'? I'm not interested in new poetry. I don't think it's worthwhile to be interested in new poetry for your cousin's sake. \"\r\n\"Hum, this will give her know-\"\r\n\"Miss Tang, you listen to me. Your cousin is a smart and talented woman, but-how can I put it? A woman with brains and talent is born to teach a stupid man to turn her upside down, because he has no talent, and he sees talent as mysterious and amazing, and his admiration is like the worship of a rich man by a poor boy without money-\"\r\n\"In other words, being as smart as Mr.Fang likes stupid women who can't read.\"\r\n\"Women have women's special intelligence, and they are as light and lively as her actions. Compared with this kind of cleverness, learning is nothing more than depositing dross. To say that a woman is talented is like praising a flower, saying that it weighs as much as cabbage and sweet potato on the balance. A really smart woman never works hard to be a talented woman, she is only clever and lazy-\"\r\nMiss Tang said with a smile, \"What if she wants a doctorate?\"\r\n\"She doesn't want to get a doctor at all. Only a talented woman like your cousin always gets a doctor.\"\r\n\"But now you have to do a thesis after graduating from an ordinary university.\"\r\n\"Then, in the year when she graduated, the situation must change, the school will end early, and she will be sent to graduate without handing in her paper.\"\r\nMiss Tang shook her head in disbelief and refused to talk. When she was entertaining, if she was a little attentive, she would be finished as soon as she spoke, and she couldn't stand to speak again. When you are in love, you can't get tired of talking and listening for hundreds of times, but it's not enough; What can be said now is extremely limited, and politeness does not allow him to take the liberty to overstep. Miss Tang saw that he was silent and said with a smile, \"Why don't you talk?\" He also laughed: \"Hey, why don't you talk?\" Miss Tang told him that there were two hundred-year-old osmanthus trees in the courtyard of her hometown. When she was a child, she often found that the noisy sparrows in the trees would suddenly be silent, stop and suddenly cry together.

He thought it was more appropriate to use classical Chinese, which was a good tool for glossing over things rather than downplaying them. After dinner, he got up grass, and at the same time he was amazed that his ability to lie would become so great. He was afraid that the joke would be too big, so he wrote half a letter and put down his pen. However, thinking that Miss Tang would appreciate and understand this lie, he happily continued to write, saying, \"Yesterday, I presented a poem by Fan Tou, which was very exciting. When I saw a famous poem by Zhang Jun, I was so surprised and hated it, so I falsely accused her of having a blueprint, and I was really uneasy. Know love, or don't be deeply responsible. \"\r\nYesterday's date was written at the back of the letter, and two lines were added:\r\n\"After the book was written, it was only after a day and night that it was read. When it was lost in front of Cao Jun, it was really unwilling. Hate hate! Also. \" Write the date of the day. He read it twice and was very proud; Ideally, it is not Miss Su who reads this letter, but Miss Tang who reads it. Go to the bank tomorrow and deliver it to the special messenger at the receiving and dispatching office. Going home in the evening, I just walked to the bedroom door when the phone rang. Picking up the receiver conveniently, he said, \"This is Zhou's house. Where are you?\" Only a woman's voice answered, \"Guess who I am?\" Hung-chien said, \"Miss Su, right?\"\r\n\"That's right.\" Crisp laughter.\r\n\"Miss Su, have you received my letter?\"\r\n\"Received. You are so childish, I don't blame you! How can I not know your temper? \"\r\n\"Will you forgive me? I can't forgive myself.\"\r\n\"Frighten, is it worthwhile to be so serious for such a trivial matter? Let me ask you, do you really think that poem is good? \"\r\nFang Hung-chien tried his best not to let the smile on his face leak into his voice and said, \"I only hate that such a good poem was written by Wang Erkai. It's so unfair!\"\r\n\"I tell you, this poem was not written by Wang Erkai.\"\r\n\"So, who did it?\"\r\n\"I did it for fun.\"\r\n\"ah! Did you do this? Damn me! \" At this time, it was the telephone, not the TV, that Fang Hung-chien owed, otherwise the happiness on his face and the fear in his voice would set each other off, which would definitely make Miss Su suspicious.\r\n\"You said that this poem has a blueprint and is not wronged. I saw this idea in an ancient French dance song collected by Tirsot, which was fresh and interesting, and I copied it. According to you, it also means this in German. It can be seen that this is a very common word. \"\r\n\"You are more flexible than Devon's poem.\"\r\n\"Don't flatter me to my face, I don't believe you!\"\r\n\"This is not flattering.\"\r\n\"Will you come tomorrow afternoon?\"\r\nFang Hung-chien said \"Come\" at once, but he didn't dare to hang up on that phone before he heard it.\r\n\"What do you mean when you said yesterday that men don't give their things to women?\"\r\nFang Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Because my things are too bad to get rid of, I have to borrow good things from the side to contribute. For example, if the guests are invited, the family is too cramped and the cooks are too bad, so they have to go to a restaurant and borrow its place to cook. \"",
        "1328f48f-35da-49e7-b4f1-9a86671421ac": "According to you, it also means this in German.

See you tomorrow.\" Fang hung-chien was sweating all over his head. I don't know if he came out in a hurry or just arrived home, but the sweat on his way was not dry.\r\nThat night, Fang Hung-chien recorded the draft letter, attached it to a short message and sent it to Miss Tang. He hates writing letters in English, because the tone of classical Chinese letters is too different, and the tone of vernacular letters is easy to turn into annoying intimacy; Only English letters allow him to write frankly \"My dear Miss Tang\" and \"Your most devout Fang Hung-chien\". The usual names of these western letters are dazzling and disgusting in Chinese. He knows that the English he writes is rich in the spirit of freedom of speech of the British and the declaration of independence of the Americans, and is not bound by grammar. Otherwise, he really wants to rely on foreign languages to be dear to Miss Tang, just like political prisoners hiding in foreign concessions. In the next month or so, he met Miss Tang seven or eight times and wrote her more than a dozen letters, and Miss Tang also answered five or six letters. The first time he received a letter from Miss Tang, he read it before going to bed and put it on his pillow. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he turned on the light to read the letter. After reading it, he turned off the light and lay down. After thinking about the words in the letter, he couldn't help but turn on the light and read it again. Later, the letters he wrote gradually turned into random anecdotes day by day, and he took them with him to the bank. When he came across an interesting story and remembered a sentence, he took a pen and whispered to Miss Tang on paper. Sometimes he had nothing to say, and he still had to write, for example, \"I got a lot of letters today, and only then did I get a breath and stretch, a-a-a-ah! Can you hear me yawning? The waiter invited me to lunch, and we'll talk later. You may be eating, I wish you' eat more at lunch and live to 9999'; \" Another example: \"this letter is going to be sent to you, and I want to write a few words.\" But you see the paper is full, leaving only this small square, which just squeezed into my heart, and it is still shy and afraid to see your face. Oh, paper-\"When writing a letter, I always feel that it is better to talk about comfort than nothing, and it is not as good as meeting. When I met, I couldn't say a lot, so I thought it would be better to write a letter. Addicted to meeting each other; At first, an appointment to meet can make the days before and after meeting be stained with light and become a good day. Gradually I hate not seeing each other every day; Later, I hope I can't meet you at any moment. After writing a letter, he always worried that it would be like a rocket. By the time it landed, the fire had gone out, and the other party only received a piece of dry charcoal.\r\nMiss Tang's contacts with Miss Su are also less than before, but Fang Hung-chien has to walk to Su's home often because of Miss Su's kindness and kindness. Miss Su only waited for his formal courtship, blaming him for floating too slowly. He just waited for the opportunity to declare to her that he didn't love her, and hated himself for being too soft-hearted and not having the courage to cut the gordian knot. Every time he went to Sue's home, he came out regretting that he had gone more this time and said more.",

Every time he went to Sue's home, he came out regretting that he had gone more this time and said more. He gradually realized that he was a westerner's so-called \"moral coward\", fearing that Miss Tang would see through her big weakness in character. One Saturday afternoon, he invited Miss Tang home for tea. When he saw Zhao Xinmei's post on the table inviting him to dinner tomorrow, he was greatly alarmed. He thought it might be his engagement party, which would be too bad. Miss Su wanted to focus on herself even more. Miss Su called to ask him if he had received the invitation, saying that Hsin-mei had asked her to transfer the invitation and asked him to talk tomorrow morning. When Miss Su met tomorrow, she said that Hsin-mei had asked him to come, and everyone had no intention to talk about it. He wanted to say how Hsin-mei had invited himself, but this remark was retracted on his lips. He doesn't want to mention Hsin-mei's hatred for himself now, for fear of deepening Miss Su's misunderstanding. He changed his mind and asked if there were any guests nearby. Miss Su said that she heard that there were two friends of Hsin-mei's. Hung-chien said, \"Is Cao Yuanlang, a little fat and great poet, invited in? With him, food can be saved a little; Seeing his Four Joy Meetballs face makes people full. \"\r\n\"There won't be him. Hsin-mei doesn't know him. I know that Hsin-mei and you are narrow-minded. When they meet him, they will fight again. This is not a battlefield, so I won't let them meet. Yuen Long is an interesting person. You are all biased, and I think your heart is in the armpit. Since that time, I won't let you meet Yuen Long, so as not to conflict. \"\r\nHung-chien wanted to say, \"It doesn't matter at all,\" but under Miss Su's loving eyes, he couldn't say it. At the same time, I was relieved to know that there was another Cao Yuanlang who came to the Su family to visit the Senate. Miss Su suddenly asked, \"What do you think of Zhao Xinmei?\"\r\n\"His ability is bigger than mine, and his appearance is also very proud. He will be proud in the future. I think he is an ideal-er-person. \"\r\nMiss Su wouldn't be so surprised if God praised the devil and socialists praised little bourgeois. She was prepared for Hung-chien to laugh at Hsin-mei, uphold justice and defend Hsin-mei. She sneered: \"I haven't eaten the dinner yet, and I have already complimented the host! He wrote to me in three or two days, and I don't have to say anything in the letter, but every letter said that he was insomnia and hated it! Who told him to lose sleep? What does it have to do with me? I am not a doctor! \" Miss Su knows that her insomnia has a lot to do with her, so she doesn't need to consult a doctor.\r\nFang Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Mao Shi says,' My Fair Lady, I want it; I can't wait for it. \" He wrote this letter, which is the expression of authentic China culture. \"\r\nMiss Su glared and said, \"I'm poor, but I'm not as lucky as you! You don't know whether you are blessed or not, just talk softly and make fun of others. I don't like you like this. Hung-chien, I hope you will be kind, and I will really advise you in the future. \"\r\nHung-chien was speechless with fear.

Miss Su has something at home, so I have an appointment with him to meet in a restaurant at night. He came home moping all day, feeling that he couldn't delay any longer and had to show his attitude quickly.\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien arrived at the restaurant, the two guests were already there. A man with a high bow and back, big eyes and a pale face, wears gold-rimmed glasses with a pincer nose, wears a suit with no fingers covered, has a bare face, no beard and no wrinkles, and looks like a naive old woman or an elderly child. A man with a flying spirit, a straight and high nose, looks like a ladder on his face, and the bow tie tied under his neck is full and neat, which makes Hung-chien envy him in despair. Hsin-mei met Hung-chien and gave him a warm welcome. Only after introducing each other did Hung-chien know that the philosopher Chu Shenming was bowing his back. The other is Dong Xiechuan, a former military counsellor in the legation of China, Czech Republic. He has been transferred back to China and has not yet arrived at the Ministry. He is good at writing old poems and is a great talent. Chu Shenming was originally named Chu Jiabao. After he became famous, he thought that the name \"Jiabao\" was not a philosopher. According to the precedent of Spinoza's renaming, he changed it to \"Shen Ming\" and took the meaning of \"thinking carefully and distinguishing clearly\". He has a reputation as a child prodigy, but some people say he is crazy. He refused to graduate from primary school, middle school and university because he felt that there was no teacher worthy to teach him and test him. He hates women the most, and his eyes are so nearsighted that he never wants to wear glasses, because he is afraid of seeing a woman's face clearly, and he often says that there are two parts in human nature: nature and beast, and he is all natural. He often looks up foreign philosophy magazines, finds out the correspondence offices of the world's great philosophers, writes to them, and tells them how much he loves reading their books, and changes his opinion by praising their works in the book review column of philosophy magazines. Foreign philosophers are the most discontented among intellectuals. Their specialized authority is not as high as that of scientists, and their popular fame is not as great as that of writers. Suddenly, someone outside Wan Li wrote a compliment, needless to say, he was so happy that he forgot philosophy. They want China to be a primitive country that is somehow isolated and backward, but this China man said a few words in his letter, which was measured, and he wrote back to praise Chu Shenming as the founder of China's new philosophy and sent him books. However, when Chu Shenming wrote again, he didn't get many replies, because those vain old men took his first letter to show off to their peers, only to find that each other received such a letter from him, and they were both \"the greatest philosophers of modern times\", which made them disappointed and angry. With thirty or forty such letters, Chu Shenming frightened countless people, and a rich bureaucrat who loved talents spent 10 thousand gold to send him abroad. Only Bergson, the great western philosopher, did not reply to Thaksin; Bergson is most afraid of strangers pestering him. His address is kept secret and his name is not in the phone book. When Chu Shenming arrived in Europe, he tried his best to write to Bergson's residence for an appointment. Who knew that the original letter was returned, and he was saddened by intuitionism from then on. Bergson's enemy, Luo Suken, perfunctory China people, invited him to drink tea once, and he studied mathematical logic from then on.",

Who knew that the original letter was returned, and he was saddened by intuitionism from then on. Bergson's enemy, Luo Suken, perfunctory China people, invited him to drink tea once, and he studied mathematical logic from then on. When he went abroad, he had to wear glasses for convenience, and his attitude towards women gradually changed. Du Shenqing hates women and smells their stench three rooms away from them. Chu Shenming wants women, so his nose is equally keen. His heart is full of women. When he studies mathematical logic, he will associate the noun a posteriori[7] with posterior[8] and the symbol X with kiss[9]. Fortunately, he didn't read Plato's Timaeus dialogue carefully, otherwise he would be lost in thought on the symbol X. He is translating into English the book on China's outlook on life written by the great bureaucrat who sent him abroad, and getting a living allowance from the national bank every month to lead a very leisurely life. Dong Yisun, the father of Dong Xiechuan, is an old celebrity. Although he was an official in the Republic of China, he did not forget the Qing Dynasty. Xiechuan is very talented and follows Laozi to write old poems. China is a country where scholars will be trained. Compared with the French, there are one or two generals who can afford pens, so they should be invited to the National College for high education. Xiechuan's generals are almost the same as ordinary Confucian generals, and his poems are good even if they are not written by Confucian generals. Wen can be poor, so his career is not good, which is a blessing to soldiers. As a military counsellor, he didn't talk about martial arts, but criticized his boss and colleagues for being unreasonable in arts and sciences, so he changed his tune. He has only been back home for a few days and wants to find another job.\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien saw that Dong Xiechuan looked like a statue, and Zhao Xinmei said that he was the son of a famous father, he was overwhelmed. He said, \"The old man is famous in the world for interpreting Mr.Sun's poems. Mr.Dong is worthy of his family's origins, and it is even more rare that he is a versatile man. \" He thinks it's a compliment.\r\nDong Xiechuan said, \"My poems are different from my family's. When Jia Yan was young, his poetry was not as high as I am now. He still hasn't got rid of the habits of Huang Zhongze and Gong Dinglang, and I made the same light as soon as I started writing. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien dared not speak. Zhao Xinmei asked the waiter for the menu opened yesterday and gave it a final review. Dong Xiechuan also asked the waiter for a bald pen and an inkstone, and wrote the tickets on the coffee table quickly, which surprised Fang Hung-chien. Chu Shen-Ming sat in danger and didn't talk, smiling like he was looking at something interesting in the depths of his subconscious. Compared with his mysterious smile, Mona Lisa's smile was nothing. Hung-chien talked and said, \"What philosophical issues has Mr.Chu studied recently?\"\r\nChu Shenming looked in a hurry and glanced at Hung-chien. Instead of turning to Zhao Xinmei, he said, \"Lao Zhao, Miss Su should come. I am an exception in my life when I wait for a woman like this. \"\r\nHsin-mei gave the menu to the waiter and was about to promise when he turned around. When he saw Dong Xiechuan writing, he quickly said, \"Xiechuan, what are you doing?\"\r\nDong Xiechuan said without looking up, \"I'm writing a poem.\"\r\nHsin-mei said with relief, \"Write more poems quickly. Although I don't know poetry, I like reading your poems best. My friend, Miss Su, is very good at writing new poems and appreciates old ones. Show her your poem later. \"",

Although I don't know poetry, I like reading your poems best. My friend, Miss Su, is very good at writing new poems and appreciates old ones. Show her your poem later. \"\r\nXiechuan stopped writing, patted his forehead with his fingers, as if remembering something, and continued to write, saying, \"The new poem can't be compared with the old one! When I was in Lushan that year, I chatted with our old gentleman, Mr.Chen Sanyuan, and occasionally talked about vernacular poems. The old man actually read one or two new poems. He said that Xu Zhimo's poems were a little interesting, but they were only equivalent to the realm of Yankee people in the early Ming Dynasty, which was too pitiful. Women are second-rate poets at most, and all that can be sung in birds is male, such as chickens. \"\r\nHsin-mei was greatly dissatisfied. \"Why do foreigners always say that the nightingale is a female?\"\r\nChu Shenming has the most research on male and female sex. He said coldly, \"The nightingale female can't sing, but the male nightingale can sing.\"\r\nJust then, Miss Su came. Hsin-mei took advantage of his master's authority to pay her a patent attentions in front of Hung-chien. After Xiechuan shook hands, he didn't really look at her, because he accepted the attitude of old-school celebrities towards women; Or tease the waves, which is a romantic affair with prostitutes; Or look at the nose with your eyes, look at your heart with your nose, and dare not look straight. This is courtesy to your friends and family. The philosopher Chu looked at Miss Su greedily, with big eyes like the philosopher Schelling's \"absolute concept\", like \"medicine popped out of a pistol\", which narrowly broke through her eyes and broke her glasses. Hsin-mei said, \"Mrs.Dong was invited today, and Mr.Dong said she couldn't come because of something. Mrs.Dong is a beauty and a good Chinese painting, which is a perfect match with our brother Xiechuan. \"\r\nXiechuan objectively criticized: \"My wife is quite beautiful and her paintings are quite French. Her painting \"Xiao Temple in the Setting Sun\" can be found in many poems of the older generation. She visited Ryujuji with me, and when she came home, she drew this handwritten scroll. My old man wrote two verses, two of which were the best:' Who is the scholar of Zhenyuan Dynasty today, and the old sunset is infinite!' Indeed, the older generation seems to be getting less and less every day, and the talents seem to be getting worse and worse.' There is no need to go back to Kanggan, and it is disconsolate to look back at Tongguang!' \"Said shook his head and lamented.\r\nFang Hung-chien had never heard of it before, and he was very interested. He only wondered why such a young foreigner sounded like a young man, perhaps because he studied Tongguang poetry. Hsin-mei invited everyone to sit down, filled Miss Su's glass with French grape juice, and said with a smile, \"This is for you, and we have our own wine. Brother Shen Ming is a philosopher here today, you and Brother Xiechuan are both poets, and Mr.Fang is both a philosopher and a poet, which is even more remarkable. I can do nothing but drink two sips of wine. Mr.Fang, I will accompany you to drink two pounds of wine today. Brother Xiechuan is also generous. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien jumped up in fright and said, \"Who said I was a philosopher and a poet? I can't drink, I simply don't drink. \"\r\nHolding down the hip flask, Hsin-mei turned his eyes to the table and said, \"Who wants to be polite today, we'll fine him two cups, okay?\"",

This kind of good wine is still cheap. \"\r\nHung-chien couldn't stop him. \"Mr.Zhao, I really can't drink. Can I have grape juice, too?\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Where are the students studying in France who can't drink? Grape juice is for ladies. Brother Shen Ming gave up drinking because of neurasthenia, which is an exception. You're welcome. \"\r\nXiechuan laughed and said, \"You are neither Miss Wen Wan's\" beautiful appearance \"nor Mr.Shen Ming's\" sad and sick body \".I advise you to get drunk when you have wine. Ok, let's drink first. If one cup fails, half a cup. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Hung-chien doesn't seem to know how to drink-it's appreciated that Hsin-mei advises you to drink a little.\" When Hsin-mei heard that Miss Su cared for Hung-chien, she wished that the wine in Hung-chien's cup would drip Hwa-Sung Do kerosene. His wish didn't come true, but hung-chien took a sip and felt a ray of fire stretching from the tip of his tongue to his chest and diaphragm. Shen Ming only drinks tea, and his glass is still empty. The waiter took a large bottle of Nainai brand A milk and said that it had been separated from the water temperature. Hsin-mei gave the bottle to Shen Ming Dow: \"Pour it yourself, I won't be polite to you.\" Shen Ming poured a cup, pointed his lips and tasted it, saying, \"It's neither cold nor warm, just right.\" Then take out a foreign tonic bottle from your pocket, count four pills, put it in your mouth, and swallow it with a sip of milk. Miss Su said, \"Mr.Chu really knows how to keep fit!\" Shen Ming breathed a sigh of relief and said, \"Wouldn't it be better if people didn't have this body and were all souls?\" I'm not taking care of myself, I'm just coaxing it so as not to mess with me-Hsin-mei, this milk is still fresh. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"I'm not kidding you, am I? I know your temper. After this bottle of milk was delivered to my house, I put it in the electric refrigerator and froze it. You are so serious about fresh milk, I have the opportunity to take you to meet a miss Xu who is familiar with us. She runs a dairy and asks her to allow you to suck a full cup of cow's milk every day-I brought grape juice, wine and milk today, and I didn't ask for it in a restaurant. Wen Wan, after dinner, I still have a box of things for you. What you like to eat. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"What is it? Oh, you're giving me a headache again. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien said, \"I don't know what you like to eat. I can buy it for you next time.\"\r\nHsin-mei was arrogant and jealous. \"Wen Wan, don't tell him.\"\r\nMiss Su apologized for her hobby and said, \"I want to eat Cantonese duck gizzard liver in a foreign country, and it is not easy to buy it. When I came back last year, my eldest brother bought it for me, which made me sore for several days. You are going to seduce me again. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"There has never been a chicken or duck gizzard in foreign dishes. I saw boxes of chicken or duck gizzards in London, and they bought them for cats.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"English people can't eat as much as Americans.",
        "84f31272-d92e-40c8-a97f-21e838b80c39": "Miss Su said, \"What is it? Oh, you're giving me a headache again. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien said, \"I don't know what you like to eat.

However, foreigners are always too timid to take risks, unlike us in China who dare to eat any meat. And their cooking principle is' tune', and we are' cooking', so their soup is especially tasteless. They cooked chicken for nothing, burned it, lost the soup and only ate chicken. It's a joke. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"That's not an injustice! When tea leaves first arrived in foreign countries, those foreigners often put the whole pound of tea leaves in a pot of water. When the water boils, they pour water, add pepper and salt, and eat the leaves exclusively. \"\r\nEveryone laughed. Xiechuan said, \"This is the same as Fan Fanshan's joke about making Longjing tea with chicken soup. When our old uncle Guangxu was a Beijing official in the early years, someone came back from abroad and gave him a can of coffee. He thought it was snuff and scraped the skin in his nostrils. There is a poem in his collection about it. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Mr.Dong deserves to be famous! I heard a lot of anecdotes today. \"\r\nShen Ming pressed his pince-nez once, coughed and said, \"Mr.Fang, what did you ask me at that time?\"\r\nHung-chien asked in confusion, \"When?\"\r\n\"Before Miss Su came,\" Hung-chien couldn't remember, \"you seemed to ask me what philosophical problems I was studying, didn't you?\" As usual, Chu Shenming had a rigid answer to this question. At that time, because Miss Su had not come, he stayed to perform now.\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\"This sentence is strictly analyzed, there is something wrong with it. When a philosopher meets a problem, the first step is to study the problem: this is not a problem, and what is not a problem is a fake problem, which needs not be solved and cannot be solved. If it becomes a problem, the second step is to study and solve it: is the solution passed down from generation to generation correct or not, and whether it should be revised. I'm afraid you don't mean to ask me what problems I study, but what problems I study to solve. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien was surprised, Dong Xiechuan was tired, and Miss Su was puzzled. Zhao Xinmei loudly said, \"Wonderful, wonderful, the analysis is really meticulous. Great! Great! Brother Hung-chien, although you have studied philosophy, you are candidly admit defeat today. After listening to such a good discussion, everyone needs a toast. \"\r\nHung-chien couldn't stand Hsin-mei's persuasion. He barely took two sips and said, \"Brother Hsin-mei, I only spent a year in the philosophy department and read some designated reference books. In front of Mr.Chu, you can only learn to be a student with humility. \"\r\nChu Shen Ming Dow said, \"How dare you? How dare you! Listening to Mr.Fang seems to look at their works as a unit of philosophers. This is only a study of philosophers, at most a study of the history of philosophy, not a study of philosophy. You can't be a philosopher if you are a professor of philosophy. I like to use my own mind, and I don't like to think with other people's minds. I read all books on science and literature, but I never read philosophy books unless I have to. Nowadays, many people who claim to be philosophers do not really study philosophy, but only study some philosophical figures and documents. Strictly speaking, they should not be called philosophers, but Philosophers. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"philophilosophers is a wonderful word. Did you come up with it with your own mind?\"",

Bertie told me.\"\r\n\"Who's Bertie?\"\r\n\"It's Russell.\"\r\nA world-famous philosopher, the new Lord, and Chu Shenming was so close to him that even Dong Xiechuan admired him and said, \"Are you familiar with Russell?\"\r\n\"I'm a good friend, and I respect him. Please ask me to help him answer many questions.\" God knows Chu Shenming didn't brag. Russell did ask him when he would come to England, what plans he had, and how many sweets he would put in his tea-\"Mr.Fang, have you ever used mathematical logic?\"\r\n\"I know this thing is too difficult and I have never learned it.\"\r\n\"This has a bad language, you haven't learned it, how can you' know' it is difficult? You mean:' I heard that this thing is too difficult.' \"\r\nHsin-mei was about to say, \"Brother Hung-chien lost, so let's have a drink.\" Miss Su was unconvinced by Hung-chien and said, \"Mr.Chu is really smart and interested! I am so scared that I dare not open my mouth. \"\r\nShen Ming said, \"It's no use not opening your mouth. My mind is still chaotic and illogical, and the root of the disease has not been removed.\"\r\nMiss Su pouted and said, \"You are terrible! You're depriving us of our freedom. I don't think you can get into people's hearts. \"\r\nIt is the first time that Chu Shenming has been told \"heart\" by a beautiful girl in his life. He was so excited that his nose-clamped glasses splashed into the milk cup, splashing milk all over the tablecloth of his clothes and wetting a few drops on Miss Su's arm. Everyone can't help laughing. Zhao Xinmei rang the bell and called the waiter to clean up. Miss Su did not dare to frown, and briskly wiped the droplets from her arm with a handkerchief. Chu Shenming blushed and dried his glasses. Fortunately, they didn't break, but he refused to put them on for fear of seeing the lingering smile on everyone's faces.\r\n\"Good, good,\" said Dong Xiechuan. \"Although it's' splashing water before the horse', it's actually' second time around'. Brother Shen Ming's future marriage will be full of joys and sorrows.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Let's drink to the future good wife of our great philosopher. Mr.Fang, drink half a cup. \" -Hsin-mei doesn't know that great philosophers have never married a good wife, Socrates' wife is a bitch, and Chu Shenming's good friend Russell has been divorced several times.\r\nHung-chien really said, \"I hope Mr.Chu won't divorce three or four times like Russell.\"\r\nShen Ming said with a straight face, \"This is the philosophy you have learned!\" Miss Su said, \"Hung-chien, I think you are drunk and your eyes are red.\" Xiechuan laughed his head off. Hsin-mei shouted, \"How outrageous! If you say such a thing, you must be punished! \" Originally, Hung-chien only needed a drink or two, but now he was fined a drink. Hung-chien knew that he was wrong, and he endured it, and gradually felt that another one was talking without himself.\r\nShen Ming Dow: \"I also talked to Bertie about her marriage and divorce. He quoted an old English saying that marriage is like a golden painted bird cage. The birds outside the cage want to live in it and the birds inside want to fly out. So leave, leave, and there is no game. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"There is also a saying in France.",

Can you be wrong again?\"\r\nShen Ming Dow: \"Never mind the birdcage, but besiege the city. People like me who are detached from everything are not afraid of besieging.\"\r\nHung-chien was pushed around by the wine and lost his self-control. \"Anyway, you will set an empty plan.\" As a result, he fined Hsin-mei another half glass of wine, and Miss Su warned him not to talk too much. Xiechuan was thinking about something and suddenly said, \"Yes, yes. Among China philosophers, Wang Yangming is afraid of his wife. \" -This is the first time he hasn't called \"Old Uncle\" today.\r\nHsin-mei snapped, \"Is there anyone else? Mr.Fang, you said that you have studied China literature. \"\r\nHung-chien said quickly, \"That was in the past, and I didn't understand it at all.\" Hsin-mei readily winked at Miss Su, who suddenly became very stupid and turned a blind eye.\r\n\"Who are the people who teach you Chinese in the university?\" Xiechuan asked without interest.\r\nHung-chien remembered that his Mr.Guo Wen couldn't be heard. Unlike Russell and Chen Sanyuan, he was like a fine Havana cigar and could be hung around his mouth to show off. He said, \"They are all nameless boys, but it's good enough to teach us students who can't understand. Brother Xiechuan, I really don't know anything about poetry. I can't do a word if I look at it once in a while. \" Miss Su thinks Hung-chien is too embarrassed, and she is itching to save his face.\r\nXiechuan sneered: \"Are you reading the poems of Yanziyan and Renjinglu?\"\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\"This is an old poem that ordinary international students can appreciate. Oriental students hold Su Manshu, while western students hold Huang Gongdu. Overseas students don't know Su Dongpo and Huang Shangu, but only Su Huang. Am I right? Huang Gongdu is better. The Japanese flavor in Su Manshu's poems is as thick as oil and gas in Japanese women's hair. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"I am also an ordinary international student, so I don't know who is the best in modern old poems. Mr.Dong told us something. \"\r\n\"Of course, Chen San was the first. In the past five or six hundred years, he is the tallest.

Miss Su knew that Xiechuan had written a poem and asked him for it. Because only those who write old poems dare to say that they don't read new poems, and those who write new poems never refuse to say that they don't understand old poems. Xiechuan handed out four or five pieces of paper at the same table and leaned back proudly, but felt that these people didn't understand poetry and could never appreciate the beauty of his syntax. Even praise would not be cordial and pertinent. At this time, he waited for their compliment, knowing that it would not satisfy himself, as if he only found a pack of cigarettes when he was addicted to opium. There are seven or eight modern poems written on the paper, and the style is very mature. The poem about resigning from the military counsellor's return to China includes: \"When a good fu comes back, look at a woman's funeral, and stop crying when she is ashamed of her name\"; The poems indignant at the war between China and Japan are: \"I doubt that the sky is still drunk and want to die with Japan\"; In addition, there are: \"the breeze doesn't have to be bought for a sum of money, and the quick rain should be sealed by thousands of households\"; \"The stone teeth wash the cold wrasse, and the pines shed the evening breeze\"; \"Don't avoid people's thoughts and the world, only help the disabled and enjoy the residual flowers.\" However, there are a few words like: \"Splashing eyes is empty for sleeping ducks, flat breasts are mysterious and charming\"; \"A few children help to find the old traces, and the sorrowful reed and bitter bamboo look sad\"; \"The autumn air is lighter than a wild goose, and the temples shake the shadows and the crows peep\"; The meaning is very obscure. Hung-chien hasn't read \"Poems of the Pure House in San Yuan\", and he is still trying to think about the source of these words. He thought that Arundo donax didn't catch fire, so it was impossible to take photos, besides, \"sadness\" was invisible to the sea lights. \"Counting children\" clearly means that friends are not children. How can friends \"support\"? Ten thousand crows take a fancy to the poet's white hair. Is it \"like a crow's nest\" to stay on his head? Doubt in my heart, afraid to ask questions, afraid of Xiechuan laughing at his layman.\r\nAs usual, everyone said yes, and Xiechuan was politely indifferent, as if the leader's expression was welcomed by the people. Hsin-mei said to Hung-chien, \"Write some poems, too, and let's broaden our horizons.\" Hung-chien boasted that he couldn't write poetry. Xiechuan said that Hung-chien really couldn't write poetry, but he didn't have to force it. Hsin-mei said, \"Well, let's have a big glass and drink Brother Xiechuan's good poems.\" Hung-chien asked the mouthpiece to shut down two times, and swallowed the wine like a tax evasion, only to feel that the contents in his stomach were so excited by the wine that he was about to come up, just like the sight of a stuffed toilet being pumped again. Busy put down the cup, clenched teeth, with a strong will to suppress this overflow.\r\nMiss Su said, \"I have never met Mrs.Dong, but I can imagine the beauty of Mrs.Dong.

We naked people are really jealous.\" As she said this, she looked at Miss Su with courage.",
        "af3df147-79cd-4a5c-b00f-b68922c25e46": "Hung-chien asked the mouthpiece to shut down two times, and swallowed the wine like a tax evasion, only to feel that the contents in his stomach were so excited by the wine that he was about to come up, just like the sight of a stuffed toilet being pumped again. Busy put down the cup, clenched teeth, with a strong will to suppress this overflow.\r\nMiss Su said, \"I have never met Mrs.Dong, but I can imagine the beauty of Mrs.Dong. Mr.Dong's poem' Good fortune returns to see the wife's death' vividly depicts Mrs.Dong's lovely smile and two deep dimples. \"\r\nZhao Xinmei said, \"It's not enough for Xiechuan to have a good wife, but she is still ostentatious in her poems. We naked people are really jealous.\" As she said this, she looked at Miss Su with courage.\r\nChu Shen Ming Dow: \"The dimple was born in his wife's face, and he was the only one watching it. Now write it into the poem, and we can all read it carefully. \"\r\nXiechuan was angry and said with a straight face, \"There is no need to talk about poetry with people like you who don't understand. I used two classics in this couplet, Mei Shengyu in the previous sentence and Yang Dayan in the next sentence. If you don't know the source, don't make a fuss. \"\r\nHsin-mei poured wine and said, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Let's punish ourselves with a drink. Mr.Fang, you should know that you are no better than us! Why don't you know anything? You punish two cups, come! \"\r\nHung-chien said angrily, \"You are unreasonable. Why should I know better than you?\"\r\nMiss Su was very unhappy because she scolded Xiechuan for being \"unreasonable\" and including herself. She said, \"I don't know anything either, but I won't drink this cup of fine wine.\"\r\nHsin-mei was already drunk, so she was not bound by Miss Su. \"You don't have to punish him. He has to have at least one more drink. I'll accompany him.\" As he spoke, he filled the wine in Hung-chien's glass, picked up his own glass and drank it off, shining it on Hung-chien.\r\nHung-chien said resolutely, \"I'll finish this cup, and besides, you won't drink my head again.\" Raise your glass and pour it down your throat. When it's finished, he saluted Hsin-mei: \"Zhao-\"He didn't say the word \"cup\". He closed his mouth and rushed to the spittoon with a fall and bump. With a \"wow\", food and wine came out of his mouth. I didn't expect that there were endless things in his stomach, but he was out of breath and lost his nose, tears and stomach juice. I just thought, \"What a shame! Fortunately, Miss Tang is not here. \" I vomited in my stomach and felt sick. I sat down on the coffee table and couldn't lift my head. My clothes were covered with dirty foam. Miss Su tried to get close to her, and he gestured wearily to stop her. Hsin-mei knocked on his back when he vomited badly. Xiechuan told the waiter to clean up the ground, take a towel and pour him a cup of tea first. Chu Shenming covered his nose and opened all the windows. His face was contemptuous, but his heart was happy. He felt that the milk he spilled and the vomiting he gave Hung-chien were washed away in the memories of the people at the table.\r\nXiechuan saw that Hung-chien was better, and said with a smile, \"I don't feel awkward when I spit on the railing.\" Why are you busy returning the meal before you finish it? It doesn't matter. I'll learn to drink after throwing up a few times. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Wine proves that I really won't drink it. I hope that poetry is not really impossible to do, and philosophy is not really incomprehensible. \"\r\nMiss Su said angrily, \"You're being sarcastic! It's all your fault. He's really ill tomorrow. How dare you be the host? -Hung-chien, how do you feel now? \" Putting his finger on Hung-chien's forehead made Hsin-mei regret that he had never learned internal boxing, because when he knocked on his back, he was fatally injured.",

Brother Hsin-mei, I'm really sorry for you today, and you're all spoilt by me. Please continue to eat. I want to go home first and come to Brother Hsin-mei's house one day to apologize. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"Sit down a little longer and wait until your head hurts.\"\r\nHsin-mei wished he could not get rid of Hung-chien at once, so he said, \"Who has a panacea? Shen Ming, do you have any medicine with you? \"\r\nShen Ming took out a lot of bottles and boxes from his coat and trousers pocket, including pills, pills and ointments to protect throat, brain, lung, stomach, constipation, sweating and pain. Miss Su picked out the tiger balm, dipped her finger in it and rubbed it on two suns for Hung-chien. Almost all the wine in Hsin-mei's belly turned sour and vinegar. After a while, he put up with it and said, \"Is it any better? I dare not keep you today. I'll take a rain check. I'll call a car to take you back. \"\r\nMiss Su said, \"There is no need to call a taxi. He will take my car and I will take him home.\"\r\nHsin-mei's eyes widened in horror and he stammered, \"You, you won't eat? There are dishes. \" Hung-chien pleaded weakly with Miss Su not to see herself off.\r\nMiss Su said, \"I'm full already. Today's food is too rich. Mr.Chu, Mr.Dong, please enjoy your meal. I'll go first. Hsin-mei, thank you. \"\r\nHsin-mei looked sad and watched them get on the bus and leave. His plan to embarrass Hung-chien in front of Miss Su today was almost completely successful, but this success only confirmed his failure. Hung-chien leaned against the car cushion. Miss Su asked him if he wanted to untie his bow tie. He shook his head, and Miss Su told him to close his eyes and rest for a while. In this self-made darkness, he felt Miss Su's cool fingers touch his forehead, and heard her mutter to herself in French: \"pauvre petit!\" \" [10] He was overwhelmed and couldn't jump up to protest. When the bus arrived at Zhou's house, Miss Su ordered the doorman of Zhou's house to help her bus driver help Hong gradually. By the time Mr.Zhou and Mrs.Zhou made a fuss and rushed out to recognize Miss Su and invited her in for a sit, her car had already left. The old couple's curiosity could not be satisfied, and it was inconvenient to ask Hung-chien, who was lying with his head covered, in detail. They only failed to examine the concierge. They also thought he had no observation and scolded him for not being able to use his eyes. Why didn't they look at Miss Su carefully?\r\nWhen Fang Hung-chien wakes up tomorrow morning, he still has a toothache in his head, and his tongue is like a brown carpet that comes in to clean his shoes. Lie down until the second half of the day, and you can get up. I wrote a letter to Miss Tang, only saying that she was ill and refused to mention yesterday. Looking back, I feel sorry for Miss Su. She called in the morning and afternoon to ask for illness. After dinner, because there was no activity in town, I wanted to take a walk on the moon. Miss Su called again and asked him if he was ready and if he was interested in going to talk at night.",

She called in the morning and afternoon to ask for illness. After dinner, because there was no activity in town, I wanted to take a walk on the moon. Miss Su called again and asked him if he was ready and if he was interested in going to talk at night. It was April 15 of the lunar calendar, and the moon in late spring and early summer was originally the lover's moon, which was no more than the poet's moonlight in autumn and winter, not to mention the reunion of the moon. Hung-chien wished he could not go to see Miss Tang. Miss Su's mother and sister-in-law went to the cinema, but everyone went out for a stroll, leaving her at home with the janitor. When she met Hung-chien, she said that she had planned to go to the movies herself, and told Hung-chien to sit down for a while. She went up and put on some clothes, and they both went to the garden to watch the moon. As soon as she came down, Hung-chien smelled the fragrance he hadn't smelled just now, and found that she had not only changed her clothes, but also embellished her face and lips. Miss Su led him to the hexagonal pavilion, and they sat by the railing. He suddenly realized that this situation is too dangerous, and he shouldn't be trapped today and regret it. He thanked Miss Su again, and Miss Su asked him again about last night's sleep. Today's appetite and the bright moon could not stand the praise three times and four times, so they all looked at the moon and kept silent. Hung-chien peeked at Miss Su's face. It was as smooth as moonlight, and it would slide down. There was a living moon in her eyes, and the red on her lips turned into moist darkness. Miss Su knew that he was looking at herself and smiled back at him. Hung-chien's determination to resist this charm was like a fish out of water, flapping its head and tail on the ground, but he couldn't afford to struggle. He stood up and said, \"Wen Wan, I'm leaving.\"\r\nMiss Su said, \"It's early. What are you busy with? Sit down for a while. \" Pointing to his side, where Hung-chien had just sat.\r\n\"I want to sit away-you are so beautiful! This moon will play tricks on me. \"\r\nMiss Su's laughter was so mild that Hung-chien's heart ached: \"Are you so afraid of being a fool? Sit down. I don't want you to sit still like this. It's not like a church. I ask you, a wise man, what will it cost you to be a fool? \" Turn to him and ask naughtily.\r\nHung-chien bowed his head and didn't dare to look at Miss Su, but she couldn't be resisted in his ears and nose, and the impression that she was smiling at this moment floated in his mind, like leaves swirling in a whirlpool: \"I don't have the courage to be a fool.\"\r\nMiss Su smiled triumphantly and whispered, \"Embrasse-moi!\" [11] She said shyly, wondering that she had the courage to be a fool, but she only dared to hide in a foreign language and order Hung-chien to kiss herself. Hung-chien couldn't avoid it, so he turned to kiss her. This kiss is very light in weight and small in scope, just like wiping the lips with a matcha bowl when the Qing Dynasty officialdom served tea to see guests off, or touching the Bible when the witnesses of the former Western court swore, at most, it is like those believers kissing the living Buddha in Tibet or the big toe of the Pope, which is a kind of closeness at a respectful distance from others. After the kiss, she put her head on Hung-chien's shoulder, like a child sighing slightly in a sweet sleep. Hung-chien didn't dare to move. After a while, Miss Su sat up straight like a dream and said with a smile, \"This strange thing, the moon, has really made us all fools.\"",

I can't stay. \" At this time, Hung-chien was afraid that Miss Su would bring up the engagement and discuss her future plans with herself. He doesn't know that women can't think of those things when they are happy and happy in love. Only when they have doubts will they ask men to get engaged and get married as soon as possible. Love is so secure.\r\n\"I won't let you go-ok, I'll let you go. See you tomorrow.\" Seeing the expression on Hung-chien's face, Miss Su thought that he was so emotional that he would lose his autonomy, so he dared not keep him. Hung-chien ran out of the door, thinking that the kiss on the lips just now was very relaxed, and it was not taken as evidence that he loved her. It seems that kissing is equal to physical examination, and it takes a certain weight to be qualified.\r\nMiss Su watched him go and still sat in the pavilion. My heart is just happy, and I don't have an outline idea. Thinking about two sentences: \"The moon is full in the sky, and the moon is half on earth.\" I don't know if it is an old sentence or my inspiration at this time. Today is April and a half, and I don't know what to do until August and a half. \"Pregnant women's bellies are stuck in the sky,\" and remembering Cao Yuanlang's poems, I couldn't help feeling disgusted. Hearing that the maid came back, she stood up and instinctively took out her handkerchief and wiped it on her mouth, as if kissing would leave traces. I feel that the rest of the night is just like a springboard for a sea bath. Standing at the extreme of the board, I will jump into tomorrow's happiness, excited and trembling.\r\nFang Hung-chien went home, locked the door and tore up five or six manuscripts before writing the following letter:\r\nMs. Wen Wan:\r\nI have no face to see you again, so I am writing this letter. From the past until tonight, it was all my fault. I have no excuse, I can't explain. I dare not beg your forgiveness. I just hope that you will soon forget me, a weak person who has no courage to confess. Because I really love you, the more I can't bear to spoil your friendship. I don't deserve your kindness to me these months, but I will always be a precious memory in the future. I wish you happiness.\r\nI regret that I didn't sleep well all night. I will call a courier to the bank tomorrow. I'm afraid there's more to come. At about eleven o'clock, a trainee came to ask him to answer the phone, saying that the surname Su was calling, and his legs were weak. He picked up the receiver, expecting that Miss Su's scolding would be heard by all the people in the line.\r\nMiss Su's voice was soft: \"Hung-chien? I just received your letter, and I haven't opened it yet. What does the letter say? I will read it if it is good, but I will not read it if it is not good; Save it for you to open in front of you to shame you. \"\r\nHung-chien was so scared that his head was almost shoulder-length, and his eyebrows rose into his hair. Knowing that Miss Su misunderstood this letter as a proposal, he had to coquetry and add some twists and turns. He quickly said, \"Please read this letter quickly, I beg you.\"\r\n\"In such a hurry! Ok, I'll watch. Wait, don't hang up-I read it and I don't know what you mean. You can explain it later. \"\r\n\"No, Miss Su, no, I dare not see you-\"I can't hide any more, and whispered, \"I have another-\"How can I put it?",
        "659d8a46-9bf2-42a5-8780-12d63b25943b": "I just received your letter, and I haven't opened it yet. What does the letter say?

Maybe all my colleagues are eavesdropping-\"I have another-someone else.\" It's a relief to say that.\r\n\"What? I didn't hear you clearly. \"\r\nHung-chien shook his head and sighed. He spoke French with his spine removed. \"Miss Su, let's speak French. I-I love someone,-I love a woman. Besides, you know? Forgive me, I beg you a thousand pardons. \"\r\n\"You-you bastard!\" Miss Su scolded him in Chinese, and her voice seemed to tremble. Hung-chien seemed to slap her on the ear and cheek, and hung up the receiver in self-defense. Miss Su's voice could not be stirred in consciousness. At noon, I went to a nearby small western restaurant to eat alone, afraid of talking to others. On second thought, Miss Su may be lovelorn and commit suicide, so she is too scared to eat anything. Hurry back to the bank, write to beg her forgiveness, ask her to take care of herself, make herself worthless, and beg her not to miss it. After sending the letter, I felt a little wider, felt hungry, and went out to eat again. After four o'clock, colleagues will leave, and he thinks he is not in the mood to see Miss Tang today. A telegram was sent to him at the receiving and dispatching office. He was in a panic and thought that Miss Su's letter was dead. Who would send a telegram? When I opened it, I saw that \"Heisei\" sounded like the name of a county in Hunan, which reduced the panic and increased the surprise. I'd like to ask for a clear translation of this telegram: \"I'd like to hire Gao Songnian, president of Dianba National San Lv University, as a teacher with a monthly salary of 340 yuan.\" Teaching \"is the mistake of\" professor \",and\" electric bully \"must be\" electric reply \" I have never heard of San Lv University. I think it is a newly-opened university after the war. Gao Songnian doesn't know who it is, let alone what department he hired as a professor. However, having a national university come all the way to hire you will eventually increase your worth, because the war has only been going on for a year, and professors at national universities are still enviable in the salary class. Ask Director Wang that Ping Cheng is indeed in Hunan. Director Wang wants to read the telegram and praise him. He said that the gold and silver shop is a small place, and the dragon is not a thing in the pool. He also said that three years of being a professor at a national university is equal to Jane's qualification as an official. Hung-chien was happy to hear this. He thought it was really bad luck, and it must be smooth to propose to Miss Tang. Today is so memorable, it has lost the old kudzu vine and added new opportunities. He told Mr.and Mrs.Zhou in the evening, and Mr.Zhou was also happy, saying only that Pingcheng was too remote. Hung-chien said he hadn't decided to agree. Mrs.Zhou said that she knew he had to ask Miss Su Wenwan's permission first. She also said that the old-fashioned men and women should be as good as Hung-chien and Miss Su, and get married early. The new-style men and women are \"heart, flesh\" intimate without getting married, but they are afraid that after eating the sweets, they will be bad after getting married. Hung-chien laughed that she only knew a Miss Su. She said, \"Is there anyone else?\" Hung-chien was so proud that he told her the exact news in three days.",

She was jealous of her dead daughter and said, \"I can't see such a person as you, but you robbed me of a good piece of fat!\" \" Hung-chien disdained these rude words and went back to his room to write the following letter:\r\nXiao fu:\r\nThe letter I sent the day before yesterday has made my mind clear. I'm all well; If you write a supplementary letter to express your condolences, it is like a tonic after illness. You are still welcome. I received a telegram from National San Lv University today, offering me a professorship. The school site seems too remote, but it is still an opportunity. I ask you to help me decide whether to go or not. What are your plans for the second half of the year? If you want to go back to school in Kunming, I can also get a job in Kunming. If you enter a school in Shanghai, Shanghai will become the only place I am attached to. In a word, I possessed you, pestered you, attached you like a ghost, and didn't let you be quiet. I've been wanting to talk to me for a long time-ouch! \"You\" misspelled \"I\", but this slip of the pen is very reasonable. Think about why-say a simple sentence, which has been reviewed thousands of times in my heart. I deeply hate that I can't invent a fresh and erratic saying. Only I can say it, and only you can listen. As I said, I have heard it, and this saying flies. In the past, present and future, no second man can say this to a second woman. I'm sorry, but I can only express my feelings with words that have been abused by people for thousands of years. Do you allow me to say that? I don't dare to take the liberty. You don't know how I am afraid of your anger.\r\nTomorrow morning, Hung-chien will deliver it to Manager Zhou's chauffeur, and he will go to the Tang family when he leaves the bank in the afternoon. When the rickshaw arrived at the door, it was embarrassed and scared to see Miss Su's car. Miss Su's chauffeur took off his hat to him and said, \"Mr.Fang came at a good time, and Miss Su has been here for a while.\" Hung-chien said nonsense, \"I'm passing by, so I won't go in.\" Then he turned a corner and went home. I think this is a glassy lie, crisp and bright, and the bus driver must be laughing internally. Will Miss Su speak ill of others and spoil others' good deeds? But she may not know that she loves Miss Tang, and what happened in the past six months only humiliated her. He comforted himself like this, and he was no longer worried. He waited all day for nothing tomorrow, but Miss Tang didn't come. I went to see Miss Tang the day after tomorrow, and the maid said she was not at home. By the fifth day, there was no letter, and his two visits were empty. Hung-chien was so anxious that he couldn't sleep and eat. He recited his letter for more than a dozen times and studied every word, conscious that there was nothing wrong with it. Maybe she still has to study. She is eight or nine years older than her. If she falls in love, she has to get married. Before she graduates from college, she may hesitate about it. As long as she promises to love herself, she can get married whenever she wants, and she must be sober. Ok, write another letter and say that she will ask for permission to have an interview tomorrow Sunday, and everything will be ordered by her.",

Hung-chien came to the Tang family in the rain, but the young lady was at home. He slightly felt that there was something unusual about the attitude of female servants and ignored it. As soon as I saw Miss Tang, I knew that she was very reserved today, with no usual smile, and came out with a big paper bag in her hand. His courage leaked out and he said, \"I have been here twice, but you were not at home. Did you get the letter on Monday?\"\r\n\"Received. Mr.Fang, \"-Hung-chien couldn't breathe when she resumed her original name-\"Mr.Fang heard that he was here on Tuesday, so why didn't he come in? I fell at home that day. \"\r\n\"Miss Tang,\" as she was called, \"how did you know I was here on Tuesday?\"\r\n\"Cousin's driver saw Mr.Fang, wondering that you couldn't get in. He told my cousin, and my cousin told me. You should have come in that day. We were talking about you. \"\r\n\"People like me are worth discussing!\"\r\n\"We not only discuss, but also study you and think your behavior is mysterious.\"\r\n\"What's my mystery?\"\r\n\"Not mysterious enough? Of course, we girls who are ignorant of the world are unfathomable. I have long known Mr.Fang's eloquence, and I must have a very satisfactory explanation for what I have done. If it's a big deal, Mr.Fang will just say,' I have no excuse, I can't explain it,' and people will forgive me. Right? \"\r\n\"why?\" Hung-chien jumped up. \"Did you see my letter to your cousin?\"\r\n\"My cousin showed it to me, and she told me everything from the boat to that night.\"\r\nMiss Tang's face was filled with resentment, and Hung-chien dared not look at her in the eye.\r\n\"What did she say?\" Hung-chien mumbled something; He believes that Su Wenwan must add oil and sauce, saying that he seduced her and kissed her, ready to refute according to the facts.\r\n\"Don't you know what you have done yourself?\"\r\n\"Miss Tang, let me explain-\"\r\n\"If you can explain it, tell my cousin first.\" Fang Hung-chien usually loves Miss Tang's cleverness. At this time, he only hopes that she will be blunt and not so aggressive. \"Cousin also told me a few things about Mr.Fang, I don't know if it is correct. The Zhou family where Mr.Fang lives now, I heard that it is not an ordinary relative, but an expensive Yue family. Mr.Fang was married before-\"Hung-chien wanted to interrupt, and Miss Tang was a lawyer's daughter. She knew the secret of questioning witnesses in court and wouldn't let him know-\"I don't need to explain, is it Yue family? I wish it were. I don't know if you have been in love in foreign countries these years. But on the boat back to China, you took a fancy to a Miss Bao, who was as good as ever, right? \" Hung-chien bowed his head and couldn't speak-\"When Miss Bao left, you immediately pursued your cousin until-I don't need to say any more. Moreover, it is said that Mr.Fang studied in Europe and got an American degree-\"\r\nHung-chien stamped with hatred and said, \"Did I tell you that I have a degree? This is a joke. \"",

All he knew was that Miss Tang was talking about herself, and he didn't have the heart to grasp the meaning of her words. It was like a layer of oily paper covering his mind. Her words could not penetrate like raindrops, but the oily paper shook the weight of the rain. When he heard the last sentence, he understood in despair, and looked up with tears in his eyes, like the face of a big child who was beaten and scolded and swallowed his tears. Miss Tang's nose suddenly got sour. \"You're right. I am a liar, I dare not argue again, and I will never hate it again. \" Stand up and go.\r\nMiss Tang wished she could say, \"Why don't you defend yourself? I will believe you, \"but just say,\" Goodbye then. \" She saw Hung-chien off in the hope that he would have something to say. It was raining heavily outside, and she sent it to the door. I really wanted to leave him until the rain died down. Hung-chien put on his raincoat and looked at Miss Tang. He was afraid to hold hands. Seeing the light in his eyes, Miss Tang was drained by that burst of tears, so she couldn't bear to look at it any more. She mechanically reached out and said, \"Goodbye-\"Sometimes, \"Won't you sit down for a while?\" You can drive people away, and sometimes \"goodbye\" can retain people; Miss Tang couldn't hold Fang Hung-chien, so she added, \"I hope you have a safe trip.\" She went back to the bedroom, exhausted and annoyed. The female servant came and told her, \"Mr.Fang is very strange. He is standing on the other side of the road, drenched in the rain.\" She was so busy that she looked at the window. Sure enough, Hung-chien stood with his back to the road outside the fence of someone diagonally opposite, and the rain in the wind whipped his unresponsive body sideways like a water whip. Her heart melted into bitter water, thinking that if he didn't leave in a minute, he would ignore the joke and ask the servant to invite him back. It was a long minute, and she couldn't wait. She was about to hand over the maid. Suddenly, Hung-chien turned around and shook himself like a dog, shaking the rain around him and leaving. Miss Tang was sorry for trusting her cousin, and she was too decisive when she was angry. She was also worried that Hung-chien would be lost in mind and not be killed by a car and tram. I looked at my watch several times, and after an hour, I called the Zhou family to ask. Hung-chien had not returned yet, and the more she thought about it, the more afraid she became. After dinner, the rain stopped long ago. She didn't want her family to hear her, so she slipped out of the door to borrow a phone call from a nearby candy store. She was in a hurry and dialed the wrong number the first time. The second time she called, she only heard the opposite bell ring, but no one answered for a long time.",

She was in a hurry and dialed the wrong number the first time. The second time she called, she only heard the opposite bell ring, but no one answered for a long time. Manager Zhou's family of three went out to socialize. Hung-chien stayed in the small cafe until this time before going home. As soon as he entered the door, the servant said that Miss Su had called. He was so angry that he woke up from numbness. He was changing his clothes. The phone rang and ignored it. The servant ran to pick it up. One as one pleases said, \"Master Fang, Miss Su called.\" Hung-chien didn't put on his socks properly. His left foot was bare. He jumped out of the door and picked up the microphone. No matter whether the servant heard it or not, he snapped-it's a pity that he was caught in the rain and caught a cold, and his throat was tired-and said, \"We are broken, broken! Do you hear me? Why do you call twice at a time? Shame on you, you're a ghost! I don't think you can marry anyone for a lifetime-\"I suddenly found out that the other party had hung up early, and I had to call Miss Su again to force her to finish her scolding. The maid listened interestingly at the corner of the stairs and hurried to the kitchen to report. Miss Tang heard \"shameless\" and hung up the receiver. Everyone was dizzy, so she managed to hold back her tears and go home.\r\nThat night, Fang Hung-chien thought about the day's events, and he had bouts of fever. He almost didn't believe it, and told Miss Tang one by one, feeling that he was despicable and unworthy. Tomorrow, he just got up, and the driver of Tang Jiabao sent a paper bag, saying that the young lady would pay for it back. He looked at this paper bag, which he had seen yesterday. There was no writing on it, so he must have written it to her himself. He knows that Miss Tang won't, but he still hopes that she will write a few words, so that the friendship can be extended by the moment of decision, and he is busy unpacking the paper bag, only his old letters. He was dejected and despondent, so he wrapped Miss Tang's letter in the original paper and gave it to the driver and left. Miss Tang received the paper-wrapped box and curiously opened it. It was a gold paper box with chocolate candy sandwich that she gave Hung-chien to eat. She knew that it was her own letter in the box, and she didn't want to open it. It seemed that the box wouldn't open, and she had not completely broken with him. As soon as she opened it, she broke it with him with conclusive evidence. I don't know how long I've been sitting like this-maybe just a few seconds-when I opened the lid, I saw seven letters I gave him, and the envelopes were all broken, and they were lined with cellophane. I can imagine that he was eager to read the letters, and he tore the envelopes and clumsily mended them with his fingers. Miss Tang felt uncomfortable. I even found a piece of paper on the bottom of the box, with the home address and telephone number on it. I remembered that it was written on the blank page at the back of his book when I first ate, and he cut it out and kept it as a treasure. She was stunned, and suddenly thought that what he said on the phone yesterday might not be for herself; The first time I made a phone call a month ago, the people in the Zhou family misunderstood it as Miss Su. Yesterday, they called twice. When they heard it, they knew that they were looking for Hung-chien and didn't ask for their names. Is it worth confirming that we broke up with each other and came to this field?",

It's like having my teeth clamped and my teeth aching. It's better than a small tree planted in a flowerpot. If you want to uproot it, the flowerpot will burst. Miss Tang has a proud temper and would rather endure pain than get sick. A few days after her illness, Miss Su came to see her every day to accompany her, and told her that she was engaged to Cao Yuanlang, and secretly told her about Cao Yuanlang's proposal. It is said that Cao Yuanlang made up his mind not to get married at the age of fifteen. When he met Miss Su, his outlook on life for fifteen years was like a Japanese house during the earthquake. Therefore, \"he said that he hated me and was afraid of me at first and wanted to avoid me, but-\"Miss Su smiled and leaned forward and didn't finish the sentence. The proposal was like this. When Cao Yuanlang met, he looked pitiful. Suddenly, he put a velvet box in Miss Su's hand and ran away in a panic. Miss Su opened it, and there was a gold chain in the box, a big emerald on her head, and a piece of writing paper under the chain. Miss Tang asked her what she said in the letter. Miss Su said, \"He said he hated me and was afraid of me at first, but now-alas, you are the most naughty child, so I won't tell you.\" Miss Tang recovered from her illness and her sister-in-law invited her to Beiping for the summer. She returned to Shanghai at the end of August in the solar calendar, and Miss Su begged her to be the best man at the wedding. The best man is Cao Yuanlang's friend studying abroad. He met Miss Tang and made great efforts, but she was bored and ignored him. He said to Cao Yuanlang with a British accent, \"Dash it! That girl is forget-me-not and touch-me-not in one\uff0ca red rose which has somehow turned into the blue flower\u3002\u201d [12] Cao Yuanlang praised his wonderful language, and he thought that this sentence would reach Miss Tang's ears. But on the fourth day after the wedding banquet, Miss Tang went to Hong Kong with her father and transferred to Chongqing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I was knocked down.\r\n[2] Geometric idioms: Proof finished.\r\n[3] mixed.\r\n\u3000\u3000[4] Jug\uff01 Jug\uff01 It is the nightingale's cry in Eliot's poem; -The world is just mud.\r\n[5] We exist.\r\n[6] Everything is full of life.\r\n[7] from consequence to antecedent.\r\n[8] Rear buttock.\r\n[9] Kissing.\r\n[10] Poor little thing.\r\n[11] kiss me.\r\n[12] Really!

The sofa desk in the bedroom, the trees and grass outside the bedroom window, and the people I meet every day are as usual, and they have not changed at all, as if they ignored the great event of being sad and humiliated. Strangely, at the same time, he felt that the world was bleak, at least his own world had changed. His personal world suddenly separated from the world of public life, just like a lonely ghost isolated from the living, looking at the pleasures of the world, he couldn't get in, and looking at the sun of the world, he couldn't get in. In other people's world, he can't get in, but in his world, anyone can come in, and the first thing that can't be stopped is Mrs.Zhou. All elders don't want the younger generation to keep secrets from themselves; It is the duty of elders to coax this secret out and force it out. After the driver of the Tang family left, Fang Hung-chien went upstairs to wash his face. When Mrs.Zhou met him halfway up the stairs, she wanted to ask him what the maid told him last night. She managed to hold back, which proved that she was not only responsible, but also cultured. She went into the dining room and waited for him to come down. Xiao Cheng eats very fast on weekdays, but today he is slowly putting it off to listen to his mother's questions about Hung-chien. It wasn't until Xiao Cheng couldn't wait to go to school that she realized that Hung-chien had secretly left home before she saw him coming for breakfast and asked the servant to hurry him up. Mrs.Zhou lost her temper twice as much because she wasted her self-denial. She scolded Hung-chien for being an asshole and said, \"Even if you stay in a hotel, you have to pay a waiter when you go out. Now he eats my Zhou family's food, lives in the Zhou family's house, earns my Zhou family's money, hides it from me, goes out to make mischief, goes out early in the morning, and doesn't come to inquire after him. What a rule! He is still the son of a scholar! The book says,' Get up early in the morning and pay a tribute to your parents,' and he hasn't read it? He has lost his head to women and has no conscience at all. He doesn't want to think that Miss Su and Miss Sugar will take a fancy to him without the cultivation of our Zhou family! \" Mrs.Zhou didn't know that Hung-chien knew Miss Tang. She said \"crisp\" and casually said \"sugar\" because of the ready-made term \"sesame crisp candy\". Words are nonsense, but they can hit the nail on the head. That's what prophets all over the world do.\r\nFang hung-chien went out without breakfast, really to avoid Mrs.Zhou. At this time, he is afraid of being questioned, and he is even more afraid of being pitied or taught. The new wound in his heart hurts when exposed. If someone is lovelorn, they will immediately show their sadness like a beggar's rotten leg in a bloody public exhibition, which will make people feel pity, or things have changed, like a soldier's golden sore and old spots, and make people stunned. Hung-chien only wants to be hidden in the psychological darkness, like sick eyes avoiding light and broken flesh fearing the wind. So he wanted to do it as if nothing had happened, so that no one could see through his secret and deceive Mrs.Zhou, so that no one else would meddle. However, it is difficult not to show the pain in my heart on my face. Women have the aid of cosmetics, rouge is thicker, powder is thicker, and red and white will clearly hide the sadness inside.",

I'm a man, and I'm not unkempt on weekdays. I can't show myself as usual with extraordinary makeup except for combing my hair and shaving as usual. I can't cope with Mrs.Zhou in a hurry, so I'd better slip away. When Hung-chien arrived at the bank, he did things mechanically, and his heart was too weak to think. The telegram from San Lv University came to his memory automatically, and he sighed and replied unwillingly. He just sent a messenger to send a telegram, and the manager's office sent someone to invite him. Manager Zhou saw him and frowned, \"What's the matter with you? My wife is angry with her liver and stomach. When I went out, Wang Ma was calling for a doctor. \"\r\nHung-chien quickly argued that he had never met her since early in the morning.\r\nManager Zhou said with a sad face, \"I don't know about you either. But your mother-in-law has been in poor health since Shuying died. The doctor measured her high blood pressure and told her not to get angry. If she gets angry, she will be in danger, so I always let her score three points. You-you don't want to push her. \" Say that finish breathed a sigh of relief. Manager Zhou was a little timid when he met this nominal uncle, the son of the squire and a student studying abroad. Today's conversation is obligatory, but he is not happy. He has always let Mrs.Zhou spend the candle with her. When his daughter died that year, he wanted to marry an concubine to comfort his middle-aged grief. When Mrs.Zhou found out, she begged for her death when she was ill, and shouted that \"she died clean so that others could fill the vacancy\", which scared him out of comfort and made her even less arrogant. What he said, \"Let her have three points\", is not the \"three points of running water and seven points of dust\", but the \"three points of moonlight\".\r\nHung-chien said reluctantly, \"I'll just remember. I wonder if she's all right now? Do you want me to call and ask? \"\r\n\"You don't play! She's angry with you, so don't cut yourself off. Before I left, I paid my family to wait for the doctor to come and call me to report. Your mother-in-law is old! More than 20 years ago, before we came to Shanghai, she had liver and stomach qi disease at that time. When you send it, you don't ask a doctor for an injection, you don't take painkillers, and you don't want to eat it! Someone advised her to smoke two opium, but your mother-in-law refused, fearing addiction. Only by using our country's indigenous methods, lying in bed, having people take the latch and beat it all over. I'm always the one who beats her, because it needs relatives to do it, and others don't care, so they hit her too hard and turned it into a stick. But now she can't stand it. This method is really effective, maybe you city people don't believe it. \"\r\nThinking about whether the unmarried son-in-law was a \"relative\", Hung-chien quickly said, \"Believe it! Believe! This is also a way to trick the nerves and distract her from the pain, which makes sense. \"\r\nManager Zhou admitted that his explanation was correct. When Hung-chien returned to his desk, his stomach was full of unhappiness. He thought that Mrs.Zhou's attitude was getting worse day by day, and the Zhou family could not stay long, so he had to leave Shanghai early. Manager Zhou went home after lunch, and talked to Hung-chien again.",

He thought that Mrs.Zhou's attitude was getting worse day by day, and the Zhou family could not stay long, so he had to leave Shanghai early. Manager Zhou went home after lunch, and talked to Hung-chien again. The first thing he asked was whether he had answered the telegram from San Lv University. Hung-chien suddenly realized, and a wave of anger woke his heart from his stupidity. When he answered, he propped himself up enough to add more height. Manager Zhou averted his eyes from Hung-chien's face. He only saw the white shirt on Hung-chien's chest in front of the writing desk slowly expanding and his tie and belt were rising off the desk. He said, \"It's best for you to call back and apply, and it's not a long-term solution to hang out in our bank.\" He also asked him to \"don't get me wrong.\" Hung-chien sneered sharply and asked if he was suspended from his post from today. Manager Zhou put on a weak dignity and said, \"Hung-chien, I told you not to get me wrong! You will travel soon, of course, you have to be busy with your own business, and you don't have time to take care of the business-fortunately, there is nothing in the business, and I will set you free, so you don't have to go to the business every day. As for the salary, you'd better stick to it-\"\r\n\"Thank you, I can't take this money.\"\r\n\"You listen to me, I teach family planning to send you four months' salary together, and you don't have to ask your father for your travel expenses-\"\r\n\"I don't want money, I have money.\" When Hung-chien spoke, he looked as if all the four major national banks were in his pocket, and he strutted out of the manager's office without waiting for Manager Zhou to finish. It's a pity that the manager's office is too small to take two steps, and his arrogant figure can no longer be seen by Manager Zhou. Moreover, in his anger, he didn't take good care of himself. His leather shoes stepped on the footman outside the door, so Hung-chien had to apologize. The footman raised his leg and smiled bitterly, insisting, \"It doesn't matter.\"\r\nManager Zhou shook his head, thinking that a woman's family doesn't understand the world, only knowing that she lost her temper at home and made it difficult for her husband to be outside. I wrote a speech in a bleak way. I wanted to talk about Hung-chien's father from his travel expenses. I inherited Hung-chien's father and said in a quick tone, \"After you returned to China, you didn't make out with your old man and wife much. Now you are going away again. It seems that you should go back to the government for a month or two and wait on your parents. My wife and I like you to live in the shed for a long time, and even if you succeed, you will not go. But I won't let you go home to be a filial son, and your in-laws and mothers will come to visit relatives and scold each other-\"Speaking of this, it's time to laugh and clap Hung-chien's hand or arm or shoulder or back to see what can be photographed on his body. It's most convenient to join hands at that time-\"Anyway, you often come to my house to play, isn't it? If you don't come, I won't agree. \" I am confident that this speech is tactful and decent, and the last paragraph is especially seamless, which makes the so-called \"logical conclusion\" of Director Wang of the Literature Department wonderful, and the letter written by Director Wang is afraid of nothing more than that. I only hate that this good conversation was awkward when I said it, and I panicked first, and my attitude was cramped. Hung-chien's son-of-a-bitch had an angry face and was beaten in the mouth. He was willing to scratch his face and contradict himself, which was really unappreciative.",

He was willing to scratch his face and contradict himself, which was really unappreciative. Don't blame his wife for hating him. The most difficult phrase is still stuck in my heart, like sticky phlegm in my throat, which makes me itch and scratch. Manager Zhou symbolically coughed a meaningless cough and cleared his throat. Hung-chien, the child, spent his own money to cultivate him, and it seems that there is not much promise. Just now, I heard from my wife that she had recently been asked to judge his life, and her life was very hard. The marriage would not end, and Shuying died for him without going through the door! Now it's a peach blossom luck, and it's hard to guarantee that nothing will go wrong. Let him go home and give Mr.Fang strict control, and let him get rid of his relationship as an elder. But I suddenly kicked him out today, and I was finally embarrassed-alas, my wife can't stand the temper of illness! Manager Zhou sighed, put the matter aside, picked up the business letter on the table and rang the bell.\r\nFang Hung-chien didn't want the shame on his face to be seen by his colleagues, so he ran out of the bank in one breath. Cursing Mrs.Zhou in my heart, she must have provoked what happened today. Manager Zhou's husband, who listens to women's decisions, is despicable enough! Ironically, I still don't understand why Mrs.Zhou suddenly made waves in a small teacup, thinking that she didn't offend her! However, there is no need to pursue that reason. If they want him to go, he will go, never stay, and never care about right and wrong with them. Originally, I wanted to buy something she likes to eat and go back to honor her at night to please her! When she learned about Miss Su's dealings with herself, she changed her attitude and often said nasty things. Xiaocheng has no affection for himself, as if he should be his gunner for tutoring him. He has to take all his homework home to do it for him, and he hates it if he doesn't promise. Besides, the kid is nosy, but he has taken careful precautions, and the correspondence has fallen into his hands. Yes! Yes! It must be that the driver of the Tang family came to get the letter this morning. She was suspicious, but she didn't have to lose such a big temper. It's really puzzling! Ok! Ok! If you are unlucky, you will be completely bad and have a good time. Yesterday, I was dumped by my lover, but today I was kicked out by my husband-in-law. I lost my love and then lost my job. It's really a fall, and it will break my nose! \"If you don't want to come together,\" just come, and simply let the bad luck make it meticulous. The Zhou family can't stay for a day, only to go back to their parents and squeeze in for a few days, like a beaten dog running home with its tail between its legs. However, how can you face it when you admit to your family that you have been kicked out? In the past two days, people have been so angry that the back of their heads is like a cotton-wrapped drumstick beating a cloth drum, which is vaguely heavy and painful, and they can't think of a satisfactory way to hide their shame, so that their families can not doubt why they suddenly want to go home and live an uncomfortable life. San Lv University's telegram, which was not known at home, must have made them happy. They were happy that they might be lenient and would not be investigated in detail. I am too lazy to think about it anymore. Relying on this good news, I crustily skin of head and go home to talk to the camera.",

I made it clear to my family that I didn't go back to Zhou's home until late, so as not to see Manager Zhou and his wife. I packed three pieces of luggage and left a letter to say goodbye early tomorrow morning. Anyway, I was ashamed to see Manager Zhou and Mrs.Zhou, which saved me a lot of trouble. I won't stay much when I move back home. I'll just find some partners to go on the road when the travel expenses of San Lv University are remitted. You don't have to go to the bank before you hit the road, so you can enjoy yourself for a few days and enjoy some leisure. I don't know how, the happiness of leisure will hold Miss Tang, and she will slip her thoughts like skating, and her heart will flash with pain.\r\nWhen Hung-chien got home at four o'clock, the old lady opened the door and shouted, \"The young master is here, madam, the young master is here. Don't invite him.\" As Hung approached the door, he saw his mother sitting on the side of the old round table where he was eating, holding Ah Hsiung and feeding him milk powder, while Ah Ch 'ou was making noise. The old lady closed the door and hurried back to tease Ah Ch 'ou, teaching him \"Don't make any noise, call' Big Uncle' and the big uncle will give you candy\". Ah Ch 'ou stopped talking, looked at Hung-chien, wondering if there was any candy for him, and jumped at Mrs.Fang again.\r\nThis Ah Chou is the son of Peng Tu, the second child. He is four years old. When he goes down to the fields, he looks ridiculously ugly as usual. Peng Tu was not used to being a father. He didn't feel the pride of the creator and the bias of the owner for that group of red meat with a slight sense of five senses. He went to Lao Zi's study in three steps and two steps to report: \"A monster was born.\" Mr.Fang Zhizhai is eager to embrace his grandson. He just took a divination from the Book of Changes, and found out that it is a \"small animal\" divination, what \"dense clouds don't rain\", \"divergence, husband and wife turn against each other\", and \"no blame for blood\". After reading the hexagrams in the Book of Changes, he wondered if his daughter-in-law was going to have a difficult birth or an abortion, and was waiting for piety to divine another hexagram. Suddenly, he heard his son's absent-minded words and jumped up with fear: \"Don't talk nonsense! Did the children go to the fields? \" Peng Tu saw that Lao Zi looked serious, so he quickly behaved and said, \"It's a boy, and both mother and son are fine.\" Fang Tun-weng choked back his love and taught his son, \"You're already a father, and your speech is still so improper. See how you can teach your son in the future!\" Pengtu explained, \"That child is really ugly-please give his father a name.\" \"Well, if you say he is ugly, just call him' ugly'.\" Fang Tun-weng remembered that Xun Zi Fei Xiang Pian said that the great sage and sage in ancient times were all ugly, so he simply named his grandson Fei Xiang. Mrs.Fang doesn't know what is wrong, but she thinks the name \"ugly\" is not good and says, \"Children look very good-newborn children are all like that. Who says he is ugly?\" You'd better change your name. \" This took out all the old goods at the bottom of Fang Tun-weng's book bag: \"None of you understand this. If Hung-chien is at home, he will understand.\"",

If Hung-chien is at home, he will understand.\" On the other hand, I picked out two or three books from the shelf in the study and turned them over to my son, because Mrs.Fang didn't read much. Fang Pengtu read the book and said, \"Children should be easy to grow up, and every child should be nicknamed by a humble name, such as dogs, sheep, dogs and horses.\" He also knew that Sima Xiangru's fine-print son, Huanxi's fine-print stone, Fan Ye's fine-print brick son, Murong Nong's fine-print slave, Yuan fork's fine-print hag, and even more, he knew that his son was called \"ugly son\" On the same day, Fang Tun-weng went to the teahouse to talk about it with everyone. Those tea friends who flattered him not only congratulated him, but also complimented him on his unique and elegant name, which was not only elegant but also loud. Only when Mrs.Fang is caring for her grandson, she often rubs her face and protests on his behalf: \"How beautiful we look! We are beautiful babies, why do you wrong us for ugliness? Grandpa was unreasonable and pulled off his beard. \" Fang Hung-chien also wrote back from abroad, commenting on my nephew's scientific name, saying that the two pioneers in the Book of Gods were named Fang Bi and Fang Xiang, and the name of \"Fang Fei Xiang\" seemed to be arguing with the ghost brother, so it was better to change it before it was too late. Fang Tun-weng ignored it. Only a few days after the war broke out last year, the wife of the third Feng Yi also raised a baby. Fang Tun-weng was deeply impressed by the \"fierce war\" and called him \"A fierce\". According to Mozi's Non-offensive Chapter, he took his scientific name \"Non-offensive\". Tun Weng became addicted to naming, and he wanted to name more than a dozen names long ago, only waiting for his daughters-in-law to keep their children, such as \"Fei Xiong\" for the male and \"Fei Yan\" for the female, according to the legend of the Tang Dynasty.\r\nWhen fleeing this time, the two little things, A Chou and A Xiong, were really tiring. Hung-chien, an inhuman widower, listened to his parents' talk about the bitterness of fleeing, and he deeply blamed his two brothers-in-law for not being able to take care of the children, which made his parents suffer. At this time, Ah Ch 'ou and Ah Hsiung were pestering their grandmother, and their mother couldn't even see the shadow, so he couldn't see it. Mrs.Fang has been a filial daughter-in-law for too long, and suddenly it's her turn to be a mother-in-law. She can't do it, and she doesn't like it. In western families, the struggle between mother-in-law and son-in-law is an ancient style that has been preserved so far. The hostility of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in our China family is not as long as theirs. Only when the daughter-in-law is pregnant can the mother-in-law rely on her to be promoted to grandmother, so she began to accommodate her. When the daughter-in-law raised a real boy, the mother-in-law gave in even more. Mrs.Fang was weak by nature, but the two were really interested in losing milk. When Ah Ch 'ou was born, the Fang family had not heard the crying of children for more than 20 years, and the old couple could not help but spoil and encourage her. As a result, the arrogance of her daughter-in-law gradually increased and her grandson's character obviously deteriorated. Feng Yi's wife was angry, and her first child was a boy.",

As a result, the arrogance of her daughter-in-law gradually increased and her grandson's character obviously deteriorated. Feng Yi's wife was angry, and her first child was a boy. Since then, the sister-in-law has been fighting fiercely. The old couple were treated fairly, and the two sons and daughters-in-law blamed their partiality behind them. When Hung-chien first returned to China, his house was big, and Ah Ch 'ou was led by a wet nurse, so it was not very annoying. After fleeing, Ah Ch 'ou's wet nurse can certainly be saved; Third Daughter-in-law was born during the war, so she never used a wet nurse. When she arrived in Shanghai, she had to use another one to get straight with Ah Ch 'ou of Second Daughter-in-law's house. According to the unwritten law of the old family, the grandson's wet nurse should be hired by his grandparents. Fang Tun-weng fled to Shanghai, and the situation was no worse than before. He cherished tips more or less and refused to use a wet nurse for his second grandson. However, he didn't mention a word about the economy when talking to his third daughter-in-law. He only said that Shanghai is no better than his hometown, and it is a place where people hide dirt and dirt, and inferior women are rarely clean. The female servant raised a child with the chauffeur, and then came out to be a wet nurse. This kind of woman is all poisonous and can't feed children. Moreover, the atmosphere in Shanghai is so dirty that the wet nurse always asks for leave to go out for the night, and the milk has changed. If the children eat it properly, they may have lifelong hatred. Third Daughter-in-law asked her to take care of the child by herself, and her stomach was getting bigger and bigger. She had no appetite to eat and her limbs were weak, so she asked for medical treatment. At the same time, Ah Hsiung could only be led by her mother-in-law. The doctor only proved a week ago that she was not ill, but nearly four months pregnant. Second Daughter-in-law, trembling with a six-month pregnant belly, privately sneered at her husband, \"I knew that, and she knew all the tricks in her belly.\" I have to coax your confused mother into being bloated and angry. Hum, I want to hide it from you! \" A woman who is a daughter-in-law in a big family usually has a small stomach for eating and a big stomach for being angry; Once you have a baby, your stomach is really big. At that time, your eating stomach can be enlarged and your suffering stomach can be reduced. The two grandmothers are now like two Okumo who are full of flies. They have all obviously reduced the capacity of the house, and the old lady Fang is overwhelmed. The two female servants also took the opportunity to argue and earn more than once.\r\nFang Tun-weng became interested in family medicine because of his third daughter-in-law's illness. He is left out in the cold on the door in Shanghai, which is not the same as when he lived in his hometown. A quack in the same town is his neighbor, admiring his fame, killing people when he has time, and occasionally chatting with him. This quack is really \"practicing medicine for three generations, and one side knows everything\" in his hometown. At last, the other side has strong resistance, and he didn't kill his grandfather and father, leaving the quartet with three sides. Fang Tun-weng, like all older scholars, is confident that \"if you don't have a good face, you will be a good doctor\" and knows medicine. The quack thought he was well-informed, and hoped that he would introduce business, so it was inevitable to pour him a few times of mystery soup.",

The quack thought he was well-informed, and hoped that he would introduce business, so it was inevitable to pour him a few times of mystery soup. This mystery soup is like wine, and the amount of people being poured is different; Tun Weng's obsession with soup was always small, and he got drunk and got carried away. It happened that the third daughter-in-law could supply him with experiments, so he wrote many prescriptions. Third Daughter-in-law thinks that the medicine taken by her father-in-law and her neighbor's doctor is ineffective, so she quarrels with her husband and wants to consult a western doctor. When Tun Weng learned about this, he was unhappy at first. He heard that western medicine had decided that his daughter-in-law was not ill, and this unhappiness was about to break out. However, it was good news that Western medicine said that she was pregnant. She was not angry, so she had to bear it, and tried other ways to save her dignity and wash away the shame of China medicine. Mrs.Fang showed Hong gradually to his bedroom. On his desk were \"Mirror Flower Edge\" and the tenth edition of the New Edition of Augmented and Corrected Prescriptions by the Commercial Press. He wanted to extract the strange prescriptions in \"Mirror Flower Edge\" in the blank of the New Edition of Prescriptions. Tun-Weng saw his son and said, \"You're here. I was just about to call you to talk to you. You haven't been here for a month, so you should come for a walk at home more often. My father indulges you too much, and you all don't know the rules and manners-\"Turning over the New Edition of Prescriptions, the other old lady said,\" Mom, since the third daughter-in-law is happy, I think she needs this prescription. Twice a day, one piece of tofu skin each time, don't chop it up, and swallow it with soy sauce and sesame oil. This thing is not bitter. You can have dinner, but you'd better not. The second daughter-in-law may as well do it. This recipe is very reasonable: tofu skin is slippery, sesame oil is slippery, and children in the womb have a slippery afterbirth, so it is easy to go to the ground, and it will not be difficult to give birth in the future. Please show them this recipe. Don't go, listen to me talk to Hung-chien-Hung-chien, you're nearly thirty years old, so you should have a sense of proportion. It's reasonable to say that you don't need our old-fashioned words to talk. But-mother, if we don't discipline our son, others will discipline him for us. We can't lose face, right-your mother-in-law called in the morning and said that you were absurd outside, fooling around with women. Don't argue, I'm not a fool, and I don't believe all her-\"Tun-Weng stretched out his left hand to his son, palms down, and made a signal to stop his defense- At your age, you are naturally married and finished; It's my fault that I tolerated you for a while, and I'll make decisions for you in the future. I want you to move back home so as not to be annoying, and at the same time, I can discipline you. You should also live a hard life at home; Young people are greedy and comfortable, their bones are loose, and they have no future. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien was ashamed and angry, and dozens of words came to his mouth at the same time. He just struggled out: \"I want to move back tomorrow. My mother-in-law is crazy. She loves to make trouble. What a jerk-\"\r\nTun-Weng said sadly, \"Your attitude is wrong. I think you are becoming more and more rude.",
        "adf33215-138c-4e6c-830d-d79544e03858": "I want you to move back home so as not to be annoying, and at the same time, I can discipline you.

I think you are becoming more and more rude. Even if she exaggerates, it is also her kindness to be an elder, you young people-\"Fang Tun-weng left a blank in his words, indicating that there are no words in the world to describe those hateful and rude young people.\r\nSeeing Hung-chien's pale face, Mrs.Fang was afraid that the father and son would quarrel. She asked her son timidly and cunningly, \"What happened to that Miss Su? As long as you really like her, dad and I will always do what you want, as long as you are satisfied. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien couldn't help blushing and said, \"I have stopped seeing her.\"\r\nThis blush could not escape the observation of the old couple, and they winked at each other. Tun-weng smiled thoroughly and said, \"Did the quarrel fall out? This is also a common thing between young men and women. Once you quarrel, you have a good relationship. Both sides have already repented in their hearts, and they are still angry on their faces. Am I right? At this time, there must be a third party, come out for a change. You won't be wronged and admit your mistake. Only my old man will come forward to make peace and give her a letter, and she will buy my face. \" Tun Weng's naughty smile and tone were so heavy that he could collapse the floor.\r\nHung-chien would rather be angry with his father than be afraid of his humor. He was so flustered that he said, \"She has already been engaged.\"\r\nThe meaning in the old couple's eyes deepened. Tun-Weng changed his face in awe and said, \"So, you are-you are so-called' lovelorn'. Well, there's no need to ruin yourself! The days are long. \" Tun-Weng not only forgave, but also pitied the son who was bullied by women.\r\nHung-chien was even more embarrassed. Yes, I am \"lovelorn\"-these two words are very awkward in my father's mouth-but not for Su Wenwan. Parents' sympathy is given in the wrong place, as if they have a wound on their body, while sympathizers prefer to apply medicine and cloth after the skin and flesh are healed. Shall we tell them about Miss Tang? They will never understand. Maybe my father will propose to Miss Tang directly with a stroke of the pen. He will make such a joke. Hung-chien stammered a few words and showed the telegram to Tun-weng. As expected, Mrs.Zhou's business was really put aside. Tun Weng said that this is what international students do, which is much better than being a small bank clerk. Pingcheng is really a remote place, but \"there should be someone in our family in the free zone, and I can communicate with the rear. You can go in and tell the relevant parties about all my actions since the fall of the place.\" After a while, Tun Weng added, \"You should send me one-third of your salary every month in the future. It's not that I want your money, it's to train your sense of responsibility to your parents. Your two brothers share the expenses at home.\" At the dinner table, Mr.and Mrs.Tunweng were obviously partial to their son, blaming the Zhou family for being stingy and unable to accommodate others. They wanted to drive Hung-chien away on the pretext that \"businessmen are businessmen after all, and they saw that our family had lost power now. We don't want to be in-laws with such mean and snobbish upstarts. \" The parents decided that Hung-chien would go back to Zhou's house to pack his bags tonight, and that Mrs.Fang would visit Mrs.Zhou's illness tomorrow to thank Hung-chien for disturbing him so that luggage belt could go.\r\nHung-chien didn't want to go to Zhou's house after dinner, so he went to the movies alone. The film was over, and it was delayed for a while.",
        "f268f666-87d1-4f6e-8938-9e471db2182a": "Your two brothers share the expenses at home.\" At the dinner table, Mr.and Mrs.Tunweng were obviously partial to their son, blaming the Zhou family for being stingy and unable to accommodate others.

The film was over, and it was delayed for a while. It was expected that Mr.and Mrs.Zhou were asleep before they slowly went back. As soon as I entered the bedroom, I found an effective English grammar textbook on the desk with a note in it: \"Brother Hung-chien: I can't wait for you, so I'm going to bed. Grammar exercises 34 to 38, please do it quickly. There is also an essay on the freedom of Chinese, with 200 words at will, and 300 words is better, so-so, and the article is not too good. I have to hand in my papers tomorrow. Thank You Very Much\u3002 [1] \"There is a big dish of loquat and husk beside the book, which is supposed to be eaten at leisure when Xiaocheng is waiting for himself. Hung-chien snorted, tidied up the boxes, dozed off, and left the Zhou family early in the morning. In fact, Mrs.Zhou regretted it that afternoon and felt the emptiness of victory. She was willing to take back everything until Hung-chien calmed down and made amends. Tomorrow morning, I found that Hung-chien had left without saying goodbye, and her son was yelling at me for skipping school for a day. She was so angry that when Mrs.Fang came, she made a risky guest appearance \"visiting relatives and scolding each other\". At lunch, Dianjin Bank sent someone to deliver Hung-chien's four-month salary to Fang's house. Fang Tun-weng accepted it for his son.\r\nFang Hung-chien lived at home and was bored. He writes letters and copies prescriptions for his father every day, and whenever he is free, he goes for a walk in the streets. Every time I go out, I always secretly hope that I will accidentally meet Miss Tang on the road, in the car and at the gate of the cinema. What if I meet you? Sometimes she can't stand being cold and proud and turning a blind eye to her. Sometimes the ideal self is to smile calmly, be provocative and polite to her, but she is embarrassed and at a loss. Sometimes his imagination grows stronger, and he goes hand in hand with a more beautiful woman, Miss Bitang, and suddenly meets Miss Tang who has no boyfriend. However, as long as Miss Tang showed sadness and despair, she immediately dumped the woman to make up with her. The ideal Miss Tang sometimes scolds herself for being \"cruel\" and sometimes suppresses her feelings. Don't turn your face away from the tears on her eyelashes.\r\nAfter living at home for nearly ten days, it was past the Dragon Boat Festival, and there was no news from San Lv University. Hung-chien became anxious. One morning, the courier sent a letter, written by Zhao Xinmei, saying that he had not met with Dianjin Bank yesterday, and that he would come to talk to her after four o'clock this afternoon when he was free, and he had something important to tell him face to face. He added, \"I hope you don't mind that there was a misunderstanding in the past.\" Strangely enough, he called himself \"Hung-chien sympathized with Brother.\" After reading it, Hung-chien was full of doubts. I think now that Zhao Xinmei has married Miss Su, why are you still looking for yourself? In the end, he won't be invited as the best man for their marriage. After a while, the newspaper came. Third Daughter-in-law scrambled to read it, and suddenly asked, \"Is Big Brother's girlfriend called Su Wenwan?\" Hung-chien hated his blushing, knowing that Third Daughter-in-law was looking at his face with great interest, he vaguely asked her why. Third Daughter-in-law showed him a notice in the newspaper, which was published by Su Hongye and Cao Yuanzhen.",

Third Daughter-in-law showed him a notice in the newspaper, which was published by Su Hongye and Cao Yuanzhen. The reader should know that Su's daughter and Cao's brother are engaged today. Hung-chien was so surprised that he couldn't help shouting \"Yi\"! I think this is the \"important thing\" mentioned in Zhao Xinmei's letter. Miss Su will marry Cao Yuanlang. Women are really stupid! Poor Zhao Xinmei. He didn't know that after Miss Su promised Cao Yuanlang, she also said, \"Poor Zhao Xinmei, he's going to blame me.\" Cao Poet was so happy that he forgot about the delicate understanding of women's psychology at ordinary times and boldly said, \"Then don't worry, he will find another object. I hope that people are as happy as I am, and I hope that he will also fall in love quickly. \" Miss Su kept a calm face, and Cao Yuanlang realized that she had made a mistake. I have always devoted myself to new poetry, but I didn't pay attention to Yuan Weizhi's two sentences: \"It was once difficult for the sea to touch water, forever amber\", and I regret it. Miss Su certainly thinks that people who take a fancy to themselves can't easily appreciate the women next to them. She won't marry Zhao Xinmei, but subconsciously, she may want Zhao Xinmei to never marry again and wait patiently for Cao Yuanlang to die as a backup. Cao Yuanlang hurried home and sent a love poem, one to celebrate and the other to make up for it. The main idea of this poem expresses the ideal of getting rid of private property, saying that he shares everything physically and mentally with Miss Su. He was passionate. He ran a few more times in the hot sun in early summer. There were two small boils on his head and a red pimple on his face, which of course he shared with Miss Su.\r\nFang Hung-chien found Zhao Xinmei's foreign-style apartment at five o'clock on time. Before entering the door, he heard several radios in the apartment playing the popular Song of Love in Spring, and the air was torn apart by the shrill voice of the popular domestic female star-\r\nSpring, why hasn't spring come yet?\r\nThe flowers in my heart have already bloomed!\r\nAlas! ! ! My love-\r\nThe logical inference is, of course, that before summer comes, she will bear fruit in her body. The female star's sharp jiaosheng contains turbidity, and more than half of it is like a snort from her nose. It is greasy, sticky, soft and weak, and has the same character as the main product of her nose. However, it should be at least as long as the nose, so as to accommodate this winding sound. Go outside Zhao's house on the second floor, and this song is also playing inside. He rang the bell and thought, damn it! Damn it! Listening to this kind of song is like reading obscene books and paintings. It is a sign of mental retardation and mental disorder. Unexpectedly, Zhao Xinmei will fall to this point when she is lovelorn! The radio stopped when the servant opened the door to pick up the business card and went in. Please come out to the small guest room with exquisite layout and several large picture frames hanging on the wall. There is a big photo of Zhao Xinmei's dead father, a big photo of Zhao Xinmei's master's uniform holding a diploma, and a photo signed by Zhao Xinmei's American teacher. Zhao Xinmei sat on the ground in the first row in the group photo of the summer meeting of students studying in the United States.",

Zhao Xinmei sat on the ground in the first row in the group photo of the summer meeting of students studying in the United States. In order to make it easy for the viewers to identify, he made a \"+\"sign on his head in red ink, which was painted on the chest and abdomen of the person standing behind him, which greatly helped him to \"cut his abdomen\" by Japanese methods. The most dazzling thing is a long and narrow color photo, in which Miss Su drives a flock of white sheep with a stick, wears a piece of cloth on her head, and wears a pastoral costume, which is full of classical, romantic, idyllic and pastoral sentiments. It's a pity that this shepherdess doesn't look at the sheep wholeheartedly, facing the outside of the frame and smiling at the viewer. According to the two lines on the side of the photo, it was taken by Miss Su during her summer vacation in the French countryside, and it was enlarged and given to Hsin-mei after returning home. Hung-chien was suddenly jealous, thinking that Miss Su had never shown herself this good photo. In addition to these photographs of relatives, teachers, friends and women, there is a pair of paintings, all of which are Hsin-mei's money. Yes, it is the \"Jiucheng Palace\" written by Dong Xiechuan: \"Queshang Yuanyang Society; There are no geese and ducks in the neighborhood. Hsin-mei's second brother, who didn't marry at the age of 30, moved to Suo-sentence, like Dongchuan Li's poem \"A man with a way\", and wrote a play about the wall. \" That painting was written by Mrs.Dong Xiechuan, entitled \"The Map of build house\". Hung-chien was just waiting for a closer look, when Hsin-mei came out, and the button of the clothes he was wearing in a hurry had not been buttoned. It was hot, and he might be a little ashamed, and his face turned red like a tomato. Hung-chien said quickly, \"I want to take off my clothes. Please be the host's approval.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Good, good.\" The maid hung up their clothes, gave them tea and cigarettes, and Hsin-mei paid her to get cold drinks. Hung-chien praised his exquisite house and asked how many people were there in his family. Hsin-mei said that only he and his old lady, three other servants, and his brother and sister-in-law all live in Tianjin. He glanced at Hung-chien and said with concern, \"Brother Hung-chien, you are much thinner.\"\r\nHung-chien said with a wry smile, \"It was you who got me drunk that day and made me sick.\"\r\nHsin-mei said in fear, \"Please don't mention that many! We can't get to know each other until we fight, and we will get along for a long time in the future, so we should make good friends. Let me ask you, when did you know that Miss Su fell in love with Cao Yuanlang? \"\r\n\"I didn't know until I saw the engagement notice in the newspaper this morning.\"\r\n\"hey!\" There was pride in his voice.

Ok, ok, we are in the same boat now, and we will be colleagues in the future-\"\r\n\"What? Are you going to San Lv University? \"\r\nThen, Hsin-mei frankly told the cause and effect of the incident. San Lv University is a newly organized university this year, and Gao Songnian is his husband. Originally, Gao Songnian asked him to be the head of the political department. He didn't want to leave Miss Su. Suddenly, he remembered that she said that Hung-chien was anxious to get a job in a national university, so he secretly sent a telegram to introduce Hung-chien to Gao Songnian to teach Miss Su to alienate him. However, Gao Songnian didn't let him go. Letters and telegrams kept asking him to go. He received the dismissal order from Miss Su the day before yesterday, and as soon as he came out, he called back and agreed. In his last letter, Gao Songnian asked him to ask Hung-chien to send his resume, and said that there were a group of fellow applicants in Shanghai who would be invited by him to travel together in the future, and the travel expenses and itinerary would be sent to him first.\r\nHung-chien suddenly realized, \"I should thank you for finding me a job.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"What nonsense! We should help each other in the same boat. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I forgot to ask you. What did you mean by calling me' Brother Compassion' in your letter?\"\r\nHsin-mei said with a smile, \"Dong Xiechuan came up with this idea. He said that those who study with a gentleman are called' classmates', those who study at the same school are called' classmates', and those who have a lover should be called' sympathy'.\"\r\nHung-chien couldn't help laughing. \"That's a wonderful name. It's a pity that your sympathizer is Cao Yuanlang, not me. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"You are so dishonest! We are in the same boat now. I am lovelorn, and you are lovelorn. In front of me, you don't have to pretend to earn face. Don't you love Miss Su? \"\r\n\"I don't love her. I am sick with you, not' sympathy'. \"\r\n\"So, who dumped you? Can you tell me? \"\r\nHiding the secret can no longer be suppressed: \"Miss Tang.\" Hung-chien hung his head and whispered.\r\n\"Tang Xiaofu! Good eye, good eye! I am really confused. \" Originally, Hsin-mei seemed to be in the same funeral as Hung-chien, and tried his best to compete with him with a gloomy expression, not daring to let him get the name of sadness alone. By this time, he knew that Hung-chien had nothing to do with his own river, and his attitude was much relaxed, and his voice had returned to its usual loudness. He kept Hung-chien, called Dong Xiechuan, and the three of them went to the same restaurant for dinner. Hsieh-chuan knows all about Hsin-mei's lovelorn love. After dinner, talking about Miss Su's engagement with Cao Yuanlang, Hsin-mei said magnanimously, \"This is for the best. They are like-minded, and they all study poetry. \" Hung-chien and Hsieh-chuan unanimously opposed it, saying that it is the last place for a colleague to get married, because each other is an expert, and no one can fool anyone. The husband will not worship his wife unfathomably, and the wife will not worship her husband blindly, so the foundation of marriage will not be solid. Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"It's no use telling me these words. I just want them to be happy. \"",

Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"It's no use telling me these words. I just want them to be happy. \" Everyone said that Hsin-mei was so calm that he was going to be a \"saint\". The sage just laughed and didn't answer. After a while, he took out his pipe and his eyes flashed mischievously: \"Cao Yuanlang's things are at least read by Miss Su; Miss Su's things are at least read by Cao Yuan. Isn't it good that there will be no readers for each other? \" Everyone laughed and said that Hsin-mei was not a saint and could still be friends.\r\nAfter that, Hung-chien was no longer lonely, and the three of them often came and went. Three weeks later, Hsin-mei invited her new colleagues to the teahouse for breakfast, so that everyone could get to know each other. Besides Hung-chien, there are three others. Li Meiting, the head of the China Literature Department, is an old colleague of Gao Songnian's. He is in his forties, wears a pair of glasses made of black crystal, looks arrogant, pays little attention to people, and ignores the weather, because it is the middle of June in the summer calendar, and he still wears a black tweed suit and coat. Hsin-mei asked him to undress, but he refused. Hsin-mei sweated for him, and his white shirt seemed to be suffering from yellow fever. A Gu Erqian, a distant relative of Gao Songnian, seems to have never dreamed of being hired as an associate professor of history. His happiness overflowed the table like boiling water, and he was especially attentive to Zhao and Li. Although he is a shriveled man of nearly fifty years old, he has the charm of an innocent and charming girl. His smile is thirty years younger than his face, and his smile is especially brilliant with two golden teeth in his mouth. A lady from Sun Roujia, the daughter of a colleague of Hsin-mei's in the newspaper office, has just graduated from university. She is young and ambitious and doesn't want to stay in Shanghai. Her father begged Hsin-mei to get her a position as a teaching assistant in the Department of Foreign Languages. Miss Sun has a round face, with freckles on her old ivory cheekbones, and her eyes are too wide apart, which makes her often look surprised. Dressed in plain clothes, I was afraid I wouldn't say a word, and my face was flushed. When she first arrived, she called Hsin-mei \"Uncle Zhao\". Hsin-mei quickly told her not to call her that, and Hung-chien sniggered.\r\nWhen Hsin-mei came back after seeing the old lady off to Tianjin, it was early September in the solar calendar, so it was time to leave. San Lv University was scheduled to start school in early October. Hsin-mei wants to invite everyone to dinner and agree on a date. Hsin-mei fell in love with eating out, and was always ready to treat him with trifles. When his friends asked him something, he had to discuss it with him at the dinner table. As if he was studying politics and diplomacy in a foreign country, he only remembered two sentences: Napoleon's instruction to diplomats: \"Dinner is better\" and Lord Stowell's principle: \"Please eat can make things smooth.\" This time, however, Hung-chien protested that this was everyone's business, and that Hsin-mei should not be allowed to break money all the time, so he ended up having a dinner party instead. At dinner, it was agreed to take an Italian company's boat to Ningbo on September 20. Hsin-mei said that he would buy five tickets for the boat, all for the big dining room, and settle accounts later. Li Gu said nothing.",

Hsin-mei said that he would buy five tickets for the boat, all for the big dining room, and settle accounts later. Li Gu said nothing. After the meal, the waiter sent the bill, and Mr.Gu rushed to pay the bill by himself. He also said that he had been saving this heart for a long time and wanted to invite all his colleagues to get together. Today was the most coincidence. Everyone said it was outrageous. Mr.Gu glanced at the bill and stopped insisting. He just said, \"Why should we share this small amount?\" In fact, let me be the host. \" As soon as Hsin-mei paid the money, he waited for it at the counter. Mr.Gu went to the toilet, so did Mr.Li. When we parted at the restaurant, Mr.Li asked Hsin-mei if there were any acquaintances in the shipping company, so it was convenient to buy tickets. Hsin-mei said, just entrust it to China Travel Agency. Mr.Li said, \"I have a friend who works for a shipping company. Do you want me to ask him to buy it directly? We have taken care of Mr.Fei's heart, and my brother can help. \" Hsin-mei said, \"That's better not. Five big dishes, please! \"\r\nIn the afternoon, Hung-chien took Hsin-mei and Xiechuan to a cafe and talked about the three people who were traveling with him. He said, \"I don't think Li Meiting can be the head of the China Literature Department because he has nothing in his stomach. You should introduce Xiechuan.\"\r\nHsin-mei stuck out his tongue and said, \"Xiechuan? Will he go? If you don't believe me, ask him. Only a pair of lovelorn losers are willing to go to that place, and Xiechuan has a beautiful young wife. \"\r\nXiechuan said with a smile, \"Don't be ridiculous, I'm not interested in teaching. If there are 300 mu of paddy fields, they will not be the king of lynx in the coming year'; Why don't you accompany me to Hong Kong to find opportunities? \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"Yes, as for me, after returning to China, I will be unemployed, and teaching doesn't matter. Hsin-mei has many ways out. He can be an official when he enters, run a newspaper when he leaves, and sit on the bench. I feel sorry for him. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Running a newspaper is to develop people's wisdom, and teaching is also to develop people's wisdom. Both of them are' spiritual mobilization' and are inseparable from each other. On the scope of influence, it is a wide range of newspapers; However, as far as the degree of influence is concerned, education is deeper. I am also going to add a life experience this time. \"\r\nXiechuan said with a smile, \"These big hats deserve to stay in your editorial to coax your readers.\"\r\nHsin-mei said in a hurry, \"I'm not bluffing, I really believe it.\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"It's a very common psychological phenomenon to coax people into believing even yourself.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"You don't understand this. Teaching can also be politics. You can see that many great politicians in China are professors, and the same is true on the European continent, such as the first president of the Czech Republic and the current French Prime Minister. People who do politics go to teach first, so that they can grasp the psychology of young people; Second, we can train our own cadres and talents, which is consistent with the creation of public opinion in newspapers. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"This is not a big professor doing politics, but a small politician doing education.",
        "e29fc9b6-5ea2-4d06-9c8b-8ebdf52498e3": "Xiechuan said with a smile, \"These big hats deserve to stay in your editorial to coax your readers.\"\r\nHsin-mei said in a hurry, \"I'm not bluffing, I really believe it.\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"It's a very common psychological phenomenon to coax people into believing even yourself.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"You don't understand this.

In the past, the policy of ignorance was that people were not allowed to receive education, but the modern policy of ignorance was that people were only allowed to receive a certain kind of education. People who are uneducated, because they can't read, are taken in by the master, and those who are educated, because they can read, are taken in by printed materials, like your newspaper propaganda materials and training cadres' handouts. \"\r\nHsin-mei sneered, \"Listen, everyone, how penetrating Fang Hung-chien's comments are! He is just 28 years old and has had an unfortunate love experience, but he has seen through education, politics and everything, hum! I also see through you! It's a mountain out of a molehill to be so cynical for a young girl! \"\r\nHung-chien gulped down his glass and said, \"Who are you talking about?\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"I said Tang Xiaofu, your lover, isn't she a young girl?\"\r\nHung-chien was so angry that his face turned white that he called Su Wenwan a semi-old Xu Niang.\r\nHsin-mei said, \"She's old and not old. It's nothing to do with me. I'll never protect Tang Xiaofu like you. She knows that you're still in love, and you'll take it back-Xiechuan, right? -I really have no ambition! Do you want me to give you a message? \"\r\nUnable to speak, Hung-chien stood up, pulled him down and said, \"Don't make so much noise! Quiet! People are watching us. I'm embarrassed for you. Anyway, you are the same as each other. Hong is getting closer, but it seems a little abnormal. A man, a gentleman, is a girl-\"\r\nHung-chien angrily walked out of the cafe without listening to him. When I got home, I just sat in a huff when the phone came. It was Xiechuan's voice: \"Why are you so angry?\" Hung-chien was just about to answer when Hsin-mei, who was on the other end, said, \"Hey, Lao Fang, I can apologize, but don't pretend to be angry! Today, as the host, you ran away without paying the bill. As a guest, we didn't have any money with us, so we left it in the cafe waiting for you to help us! S.O.S.[2] Come on! Drink a glass of water and wine at night to apologize. \" Hung-chien couldn't help laughing. \"I'm coming.\"\r\nOn the afternoon of the 19th, Hsin-mei handed Hung-chien the tickets bought by Li Meiting, saying that the shipping company had rescheduled the sailing to 6: 30 pm on the 22nd, and everyone was on board at 6: 00. In ancient western countries, whenever someone disappeared, everyone said, \"This person is either dead or has gone to teach.\" Although Fang Hung-chien was not afraid of teaching as if he were afraid of death, he felt that this teaching was part of bad luck. He was listless for days, and he was inexpressibly timid about traveling, and he could put it off day by day. But the shipping company really gave two days' grace, and he hated the delay, so he might as well leave early. He took three pieces of luggage: a big box, a bedbag and a suitcase. Mrs.Fang prepared clothes and bedding for him and said, \"When you marry a daughter-in-law, I don't have to take care of these things.\" Fang Tun-weng said, \"I'm afraid you have to worry about it. Now those female students only enjoy ready-made goods and don't know anything.\"",

Now those female students only enjoy ready-made goods and don't know anything.\" Mrs.Fang thought that the weather in early autumn was unpredictable, so as to prevent her son from catching cold on the road, she asked him to take an extra small bedding roll and tie up the thin quilts and clothes he needed at night, so as not to open the big bedding every day. Hung-chien was afraid of too much baggage, saying that Kao Sung-nien's letter said that it would be a week sooner or ten days later, and the weather would not be cold, so it would be enough to put a thin wool blanket in the suitcase. Fang Tun-weng has many parting words for his son. Remember, it sounds good to be in pairs, such as \"grit your teeth and stand firm\", \"you can miss home for a long time, but not for a moment\", and so on. Hung-chien knew that although these words were said to himself, they were mainly recorded in diaries and memoirs to show future generations how Fang Tun-weng taught his son to be righteous. Because Tun Weng had nothing to do recently, he suddenly found himself, like a child looking at his face in the mirror, shaking his head and staring at him with relish. This kind of spiritual self-pity made him write an autobiography and keep a diary, just like a woman wearing Chinese and western clothes in spring, summer, autumn and winter, making various postures of supporting her neck and standing and sitting, and taking photos as a souvenir. These records prove Fang Tun-weng's superiority from various aspects and facts. Everything he says and does now, at the same time, he thinks about how to remember the law in his diary and words and deeds. Records are not completely hollowed out. For example, when a bubble breaks, there is always a drop of water left. People who study language psychology know at a glance that they are \"Chinese crazy\"; People who want to lead, whether they are civil and military officials or businessmen, all reveal this morbid state. When friends come, Tun Weng often shows them his diary. The quack in the neighborhood knew that the eldest son had promiscuous girlfriends in front of the Dragon Boat Festival and gave Tun Weng a reprimand. As a result, his son was \"shocked by it and regretted it.\" Another example is the diary the day before yesterday that he told Hung-chien to say goodbye to Zhou's family, but Hung-chien refused and scolded Mrs.Zhou for being mean and snobbish. How did he teach his son that \"a gentleman is humble and blames others, and his relatives have no loss, so he has no loss\"? As a result, his son was \"speechless\". Actually, Hung-chien didn't scold Mrs.Zhou. It was Tun Weng himself who was dissatisfied with her, so he used this technique of Piriyangqiu to praise or criticize her. Hung-chien did not want to say goodbye at first, but he finally went, and if he didn't see anyone, he would be pardoned. A day later, Zhou Jia sent four-color dishes. Hung-chien, an unreasonable man, was very angry when he learned this, and would not let his mother suffer. Mrs.Fang told her son to go down and tell the giver that he refused to see the Zhou family's coachman. As a result, the driver of the Zhou family pushed around, dropped something and slipped away. Hung-chien is a bull and doesn't eat anything sent by the Zhou family. Fang Tun-weng added an article in his diary, laughing at his son's desire to be \"Uncle Boyi who doesn't eat Zhou Su\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Thank you.\r\n[2] International distress signal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfive\r\n\r\n\r\nHung-chien wants to call a car to the ship dock.",

The smart and capable Peng Tu said that the price of cars has recently increased several times. Hung-chien's luggage is simple and he is not in a hurry. It is better to call two foreign cars. Anyway, Feng Yi will send them. At about five o'clock on the afternoon of 22nd, the two brothers went out and pulled the car to the edge of the French Concession. A French policeman led two Annan policemen to search for pedestrians, and only cars could pass easily. When Hung-chien saw the French policeman, he came to Shanghai with himself last year. He spoke on the boat several times, and he seemed to know Hung-chien. He waved his hand and let Hung-chien's car pass. The French policemen that Hung-chien wanted to go with him were all rural people who had just left home, and none of them were cold, embarrassed and miserable. Once upon a time, the one I just saw has been colored and enlarged. Originally pale, his face is now as red as raw beef, his eyes are newly woven with red silk, and his belly is as fat as a frog. The nickname of the French in the world is \"Frog\", which is truly worthy of the name. What is surprising is that he has added a fierce beast. Shanghai is comparable to the witch island in Greek mythology. If you come alone, you will become a beast. As for the Annan patrol, it's even more ridiculous. There are no people in the East who are so trivial and unworthy of wearing uniforms as the Annan people. The Japanese just have too short legs to hang a command knife. The Annan people are like a dove with dark skin and teeth. They are born with opium ghosts and batons, which are more like an opium gun. These thoughts of Hung-chien seemed to be guessed by Annan's patrol. He stopped Feng Yi's backward car and couldn't retaliate and search it. He cut all the biscuit boxes and canned meat floss, and secretly reached out and asked for three yuan. In the end, the bedding bag remained intact. Hung-chien was in charge of the two boxes, and it was inconvenient to turn back on the way. He got off at the dock and couldn't find Feng Yi, so he was in a hurry for a long time.\r\nHung-chien and Hsin-mei were in the same cabin, and Miss Sun met them, but Li Gu was nowhere to be found. When the boat left, there was no sign of them. Hsin-mei was so anxious that he was sweating all over, and Miss Sun from Hung-chien also helped him panic. While he was worried, the waiter came and said that a guest in the third class wanted to talk to Hsin-mei, so he couldn't come in first class, so he could only ask Hsin-mei to go down. Hung-chien and Hsin-mei went to have a look, and it was Mr.Gu, dancing and calling them down. They asked quickly, \"Where is Mr.Li?\" Mr.Gu said, \"He's in my cabin, washing his face. Mr.Li's friend only bought three large dining rooms, so Mr.Li and I gave them all to you and took the cabin instead. \" Two people listened to, very sorry. Mr.Gu said, \"The cabin is comfortable enough. I'll show you around.\" They followed him into the cabin, full of luggage, and Mr.Li was washing his feet. Hsin-mei and Hung-chien solemnly thanked him for the shipping space. Mr.Gu put in: \"There were only two big food rooms, but Mr.Li begged his friend again and again and finally got the third one.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Actually, you two old gentlemen have one for each, and we young people should suffer a little.\"",
        "1b1412fa-93a7-4487-a54c-27db1b2513ba": "They asked quickly, \"Where is Mr.Li?\" Mr.Gu said, \"He's in my cabin, washing his face.

I have also sat in the big dish room, which is not much more comfortable than the cabin. \"\r\nAfter dinner, the boat was a little shaky. Hung-chien and Hsin-mei sat side by side in long chairs nailed to the deck. Hung-chien listened to the sound of wind and water, looked at the darkness of the sea and sky, and remembered many scenes on the ship that returned to China last year, which seemed to be twins with tonight. He was filled with emotion. Hsin-mei smoked the big pipe that Hung-chien gave him and suddenly said, \"Hung-chien, I have a suspicion. But this suspicion is too despicable; If the suspicion is wrong, it will prove that I am a villain and measure people with the heart of a villain. \"\r\n\"You say-as long as it's not me who suspects.\"\r\n\"I think both Li and Gu are lying. I'm sure I can buy all five big dishes. They want to save money, so they make up many words out of thin air. You see, Li Meiting stopped to get tickets that day. Before boarding the boat, he didn't say a word about the difficulty of buying tickets. If he mentioned it, I would send someone to do it. There must be a ghost in this. I am angry that they have smashed ghosts and earned our gratitude. \"\r\n\"I think you're right. Why not be honest about saving money? We can also sit in the cabin. Besides, didn't the school remit 100 yuan per person for travel? Gao Songnian wrote that the travel expenses were more than enough. What small money did he save? \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"That's not true. We are not tired at home; They are all elderly people with children, and maybe their families need to be arranged. Gao Songnian's words are not accurate either. It's no better to walk now than in peacetime, and the cost is uncertain. It's better to bring more money. How much do you bring? \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I have all the money left in my pocket with me, including the travel expenses remitted, which is 160 to 70 yuan.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"That's enough. I brought 200 yuan. I am afraid that Li Hegu will leave most of the school travel expenses at home and bring so much luggage. If there is not enough money on the road, it will not delay everyone's business. \"\r\nHung-chien said with a smile, \"I think they packed the whole family in luggage, including the wife, son and even the house where they lived. Don't you think Li Meiting's iron box is as tall as a person? They don't have to leave money at home. \"\r\nHsin-mei also smiled and said, \"Hung-chien, I'm going to change my style on the way. I am better at spending money, being greedy and being comfortable than you. In Li Hegu's eyes, we may be a pair of ignorant boys, ignorant of material difficulties and inconsiderate of others. From now on, I'm not in charge, and I'm at their disposal. Lest we choose expensive hotels and restaurants and force them to spend money with us. Buying a boat ticket this time is a good lesson. \"\r\n\"Chen, you are great! It's really democratic, and he will be a big president in the future. We have already tired Miss Sun of buying a boat ticket this time. She is a girl with a tender face and can't say anything. As an' uncle', you should think for her. \"\r\n\"Yeah. Besides, Miss Sun didn't give travel expenses to the school, so I forgot to tell you. \"\r\n\"Why?\"",

Perhaps the position of teaching assistant is too small, and the school feels that it is not worthy of subsidizing travel expenses. Anyway, there are plenty of such talents. \"\r\n\"This is outrageous. We are already making money, but we don't have to post the travel expenses. When Miss Sun comes out to work for the first time, where can we ask her to lose money? When you get to school, you must fight with the authorities for her. \"\r\n\"I think so, too. It's always no problem to get a replacement.\"\r\n\"Hsin-mei, I have a joke. Don't be angry. This road is the first time for us, and the traffic is not convenient. People like us who have no travel experience can't take care of themselves. Why did you take a delicate Shanghai girl with you? If she can't bear hardships and falls ill halfway, isn't it a burden? Unless you don't have an intention, then-\"\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense! I don't know the trouble on the road, but it's hard to be merciful! She is a foreign language department, I am a political department, and when she comes to school in the future, she will be someone else's Office Wife, which is different from my way. And I told this girl in advance that the road was very hard, no worse than Shanghai, and she said that she could afford to suffer. \"\r\n\"If she can afford to suffer, you will be sweet on the way.\"\r\nHsin-mei ostentatiously burned his pipe in Hung-chien's face and said, \"You want me to introduce you, don't you? That's easy! \"\r\nHung-chien covered his face with his hand and said with a smile, \"To tell you the truth, I haven't really looked at her. She didn't even see her round face clearly. Really, we are so rude! At dinner, we talked about our words and ignored her. After dinner, we ran to the deck and left her alone. The first time she left home, she felt even more uncomfortable. \"\r\n\"We have suffered from women's losses, and we are all frightened. We are afraid when we see women's shadows. But you're so gentle, you're already in love. Let me report to miss sun and say,' Mr.Fang is hurting you!' \"\r\n\"Don't worry, I will never be your' sympathizer'; You have wine, save it for me when I eat your wedding banquet with Miss Sun. \"\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense! Are you embarrassed to hear that? I have recently realized that I will never love urban women with college background again. I've been waiting on Su Wenwan hard enough. I want a woman to wait on me in the future. I'd rather marry an honest, simple country girl than receive a profound education, as long as I am healthy and obedient, and let me be her Lord and Master[2] comfortably [2]. I don't think love should occupy such an important position in life. Many people are not in love and live the same life. \"\r\n\"Your words to my father heard, it's time to say' obedient'. But if you want to be an official in the future, it is not enough for such a country girl to be an official wife. She will not help you socialize and win you over. \"\r\n\"I'd rather be an official than an official wife; Don't want her to be an official wife, forcing me to be an official and a corrupt official. For example, if I marry Su Wenwan, I won't be able to go to San Lv University with you this time. She wants me to go where she likes. \"",

You have more faith in marriage and things than I do. I still remember that time when Chu Shenming or Miss Su talked about \"besieged city\". I feel this way about everything in life recently. For example, I really wanted to go to San Lv University, so I accepted the letter of appointment. Recently, the more I think about it, the more boring it is. At this time, I hate myself for not having the courage to return to Shanghai. After this time, I don't know when I will get married, but I think you really married Miss Su, and the taste is just as good as yours. The dog lost the bones in his mouth in pursuit of the shadow of the bones in the water! I got married with my lover as I wished. I'm afraid I'll be sorry for the shadow that I can't see again at that time. I ask you, do you know what Cao Yuanlang was forced to do by his wife after he got married? \"\r\n\"He is the director of the' Wartime Materials Committee', which is a job for him by his new father-in-law. This is part of his daughter's dowry.\"\r\n\"good! Country, country, country is home! You married Miss Su. Isn't this decent job yours? \"\r\n\"Bah! It depends on nepotism, that man has no backbone. \"\r\n\"Maybe people say you are like a fox. If you can't eat grapes, you will say that they are sour.\"\r\n\"I'm not jealous. Let me tell you, I went to the ceremony on Miss Su's wedding day-\"Hung-chien would only say,\" Huh? \" -\"Sue home has an invitation, I sent a gift-\"\r\n\"What gift?\"\r\n\"A big flower basket.\"\r\n\"What flowers?\"\r\n\"Anyway, just send it to the flower shop, whatever it is.\"\r\n\"It should be apricot flowers, indicating that you love her and she doesn't love you; There are daffodils, indicating that her heart is too hard; Plus wormwood, it means that you are suffering for her for life. In addition, it should be accompanied by carnation to increase the power of this meaning. \"\r\n\"Nonsense! Where there are apricot flowers and daffodils in summer, you are an armchair strategist. Well, since you are an expert, you yourself-give someone away to get married like this in the future. The purpose of my visit that day was to test whether I had the courage to see the woman I loved for more than ten years marry someone else. Hey! After I went, I was not shocked and sad. I have never met Cao Yuanlang. At first, I thought Miss Su appreciated him, and he must be better than me. I was beaten by others, and I felt very sad. Seeing such a strange thing that day, Miss Su took a fancy to him! To be honest, a woman with such a vision doesn't deserve to marry me, and I don't want her. \"\r\nHung-chien patted Hsin-mei on the thigh and said, \"Happy! Happy! \"\r\n\"They were engaged for a few days, and the old lady Sue came to see my mother and said a lot of nice things, saying that Wen Wan had a stubborn temper, and she advised her daughter that it was useless.

Even better-I said you wanted to laugh-she prayed silently for my happiness every morning when she lit incense in front of the bodhisattva-\"Hung-chien couldn't help laughing-\"I said to my mother, why didn't she read a few volumes of sutras and cross over to me? My mother thought I was very concerned and asked me many boring things. Su Hongye had something to do in Chongqing this time, so she couldn't come back. She wrote that everything was up to her daughter, as long as she was satisfied. This couple are very foreign-styled, and they are opposed to the old-fashioned marriage, and they advocate choosing foreign days. It is said that May in the solar calendar is the most unfavorable for marriage, and June in the solar calendar is the most suitable for marriage. However, their engagement was already in June, so they postponed their marriage until early September. It is said that the days are also very particular. Monday, 123 is a good day to get married, especially Wednesday. 4561 is getting worse every day, and as a result, they chose Wednesday-\"\r\nHung-chien said with a smile, \"This must be a trick that that guy Cao Yuanlang came up with.\"\r\nHsin-mei said with a smile, \"All in all, you European students are the most annoying and have the most variety. It happened that on the Wednesday of the wedding, the weather was autumn tiger and it was extremely hot. On the way, I thought, fortunately, I am not the groom today. Although there was air conditioning in the auditorium, Cao Yuanlang wore a black tweed dress and was so busy that he was sweating all over. I think the white collar he wore was yellow and soft with sweat. I'm afraid his whole fat body will melt into sweat, like a foreign candle into a pool of oil. Miss Su is also nervous and ugly. At the wedding ceremony, the bride and groom can't cry or laugh. It doesn't look like a wedding ceremony at all. It looks like-no, it doesn't look like the guillotine. Yes, it looks like the expressions in the photos of criminals under the' Beware of Hands' sign in public places. It suddenly occurred to me that even if I married myself, I would inevitably look like a cracked hand in full view. Therefore, it suddenly dawned on me that the happy wedding photo with eyebrows and smiles was not taken at that time. \"\r\n\"Great discovery! Big discovery! What I am interested in is how Miss Su saw you that day. \"\r\n\"I didn't show it to her, so I just said a few words to Miss Tang-\"Hung-chien's heart jumped heavily, just like a truck slapping a parcel underground when unloading, only wondering that Hsin-mei didn't hear it-\"She was the bridesmaid that day, saw me and asked me if I was coming to fight, and said that after the ceremony, I was the only one who sprinkled colorful notes on the couple. She asked me about my future plans, and I told her to go to San Lv University. I thought she might not want to hear your name, so I didn't mention you a word. \"\r\n\"That's best! Don't mention me, don't mention me. \" Hung-chien spoke mechanically, as if the prisoner in the dark prison were groping for a match. As soon as it was lit, the match went out, and the one that was not clearly seen slipped back into the darkness. For example, in the dark, two ships greeted each other and brushed past each other.

The man who is the best man, a friend of Cao Yuanlang, keeps pestering her for a moment. I think he is very interested in Tang Xiaofu. \"\r\nSuddenly, Hung-chien hated Miss Tang, and his heart ached like a thorn. He suppressed the trembling in his voice and said, \"I don't want to hear about such people. Don't talk about them.\"\r\nWhen Hsin-mei heard this, he was suddenly stunned. Suddenly, he realized that he had put his hand on Hung-chien's shoulder and said, \"We've had enough. At this time, the sea breeze is very strong. Go back to the cabin and sleep. You will go ashore early tomorrow morning. \" When you speak, yawn. Hung-chien followed him. Just as he turned the corner, Miss Sun stood up from the stool and greeted him. Startled, Hsin-mei asked her how long she had been alone on the deck. The wind was very strong and she was not afraid of the cold. Miss Sun said that the child brought by the woman in the same cabin was upset by crying, so she came out for a change of air. Hsin-mei said, \"It's a little stormy at this time. Do you get seasick?\" Miss Sun said, \"Not bad. The storm that Mr.Zhao and Mr.Fang met when they went abroad must be much more interesting than this. \" Hsin-mei said, \"The stakes are very high. But Mr.Fang and I are not going the same way, \"he said, touching Hung-chien with his hand to hint that he should not be so rude and silent.\" At this time, Hung-chien's heart seemed to be racing against the pain in his heart, trying to run fast so as not to let the pain catch up, and talking nonsense, as if throwing some obstacles to temporarily stop the pain from catching up, so he told a lot of stories about going abroad. He talked about flying fish, which Miss Sun had never heard of, and asked if she had seen a big whale. Hsin-mei thinks this question is unquestionably naive. Hung-chien said, \"Yes, there are plenty. Once, the boat we were on was dangerously embedded in the teeth of a whale. \" The light shone on Miss Sun's surprised eyes, which were as round as Giotto's \"\u25cb\". Hsin-mei's suspicion deepened and he said, \"Listen to his nonsense!\" Hung-chien said, \"What I said is absolutely true. The fish had lunch and was taking a nap. Miss Sun, you know that some people listen and see with their mouths. They open their mouths to listen, open their mouths to see and open their mouths to sleep. This fish has a cold in its nose, so when it sleeps, its mouth is open. Fortunately, its teeth are firmly stuffed with meat scraps, otherwise our ship is really dangerous. \" Miss Sun said, \"Mr.Fang is fooling me, Uncle Zhao, isn't he?\" Hsin-mei made a contemptuous sound in his nose. Hung-chien said, \"It's true that a fish can slip into a sea boat through its teeth. You don't believe me, I can turn-\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Stop fooling around. It's time for us to go to bed. Miss Sun, your father gave you to me. I'm going to force you to go back to the cabin. Don't catch cold-\"Hung-chien laughed.\" What a good uncle! \"",

He tried to find words first aid and said, \"Hsin-mei, you still hurt me even now!\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"You have no conscience! Just now, my onlookers saw it clearly, Miss Sun-alas! This girl is very slippery. I brought her here and was taken in-Miss Sun is like that whale, and she opened her mouth. You idiot is like the boat that was sent to the door. \"\r\nHung-chien rolled over with laughter and said, \"Nervous! Nervous! \" I really finished laughing, followed by a fake smile to scare away the pain in my heart.\r\n\"I believe what we said, all to the girl. It's all your fault for raising your voice so high-\"\r\n\"Yourself, I didn't.\"\r\n\"Do you want to, a college graduate will be so naive? Mr.Fang is fooling me, isn't he?' \"-Hsin-mei forced her throat, confidently imitating it perfectly-\"I'm not fooled by her! Only you fool! I'm telling you, you can't judge by appearances. Did you notice that I told her that what you said was all fairy tales? If I don't say this sentence, she must ask you to borrow books to read-\"\r\n\"I don't have to borrow it.\"\r\n\"Don't say that. Everyone knows that women refuse to spend money on books. Men are willing to buy sugar, clothes and cosmetics for women, but they are only willing to lend her books, and women don't want him to give them to her if they don't buy them. What is the truth? Borrowed and returned, a book can be used as an excuse for two contacts, and there is no trace. This is the inevitable preliminary of men's and women's love. When you borrow a book, the problem will be big. \"\r\nHung-chien smiled and said, \"You are terrible! But what you said about Miss Sun is a complete pipe dream. \"\r\nHsin-mei smiled smugly at the top of the cabin. \"I didn't see that either. Well, stop talking, I'm going to sleep. \" Hung-chien knew that today's sleep was as unattainable as Tang Xiaofu's. Thinking about this difficult long night, he felt a fear of being alone in the wilderness late at night. He tried his best to find words to tell Hsin-mei that Hsin-mei ignored him and hung-chien let the pain eat away at his heart without resistance or help.\r\nEarly tomorrow morning, the ship stopped far away without entering the port. By noon, the shipping company sent two petrol boats to ferry the guests ashore. The first second-class and some third-class passengers get on the first boat first. The deck of this ship is five or six feet lower than the deck of the third-class cabin of a large ship, so passengers have to jump. As soon as the water ripples, the two ships are away from the sea with a ruler, just like opening their mouths and waiting for someone to fall in. The passengers called the shipping company a jerk at the same time, but everyone jumped at the risk of their lives and nothing went wrong.

People who have a stomachache want to come to a lot, all of them put their hands on their stomachs, frowning and saying nothing. Hung-chien was only worried that he would get appendicitis. The boat was crowded, and all the way there was only a shout: \"The boat is sideways, so people on the left go to the right.\" \"Good! There are too many people on the right! Do you want to die? \" Every sentence was shouted by the whole ship, and snowballed in everyone's mouth, and the outline became more and more bloated. Hung-chien talked with people and learned that it was hard to find a hotel when he landed, and nine of the ten hotels were full. Hsin-mei said that there were hundreds of guests on the same boat, and Li Hegu was on the second boat. He had to wait for them before going to the hotel, fearing that he would have to camp out today. When the boat landed, Hsin-mei and Miss Sun went to the hotel with their luggage. Hung-chien stayed at the dock and waited for Li Gu, and Hsin-mei would pick them up after staying at the hotel. As soon as Hsin-mei and others left, an air raid alarm was suddenly sounded, and Hung-chien became anxious. He thought that bad luck had come with him, and he was in bad luck, so he could not be killed, which worried Li Gu on board. On second thought, this ship is the property of the Italians, an ally of Japan. It won't be bombed, but it's important to run for your life. Later, when people on the dock didn't run away, Hung-chien stayed. Fortunately, no emergency alarm was put on. More than an hour later, the alarm was lifted and Hsin-mei came. After a while, the second boat approached the shore in a dark and noisy way. At first glance, Hung-chien saw Mr.Li's big iron box, which lined the narrow bow, as if a big nose and a wide mouth were born on a small face, which made people feel more surprised than the whole, and seemed to overturn the geometric principle. It is a miracle of physics that that big box can be transported from a big ship. Mr.Li's black glasses are missing from his face, and his big white eyes are like hard-boiled eggs peeled off. Hsin-mei quickly asked where the glasses were, and Mr.Li took them out of his pocket and put them on, saying that in case the glasses slipped down his nose and broke when he jumped off the boat.\r\nMr.Li missed the first boat because of the baggage. However, in Li Mei-ting's tone, it seemed as if the horror of the air raid on the ship had taken the place of Hsin-mei and others. If he hadn't given Hsin-mei the big dining room, he would have the priority to get on the ferry, so he wouldn't be caught in the middle of fire and water, and his nerves would be hit. Hsin-mei and Hsin-mei's ability to pretend and socialize is bankrupt here, and they can't express their gratitude. Gu erqian's interest did not diminish, and he shouted, \"What a lucky day! What a narrow escape! At that time, I didn't expect to meet you two again. I think the whole ship today depends on Mr.Li's blessing-Mr.Li, you are on board, so the plane didn't patronize. This is not absurd, I believe in fate. Zeng Wenzheng said:' Don't believe in heaven, believe in luck.' \"Mr.Li was like a cold-blooded animal that was stung in winter.

Before I went out this time, a friend told me that I was in luck now, and all the way. \" Mr.Gu clapped his hands and said, \"Isn't that right? I'm not at all wrong. \" Hung-chien couldn't help saying, \"I've made my fortune, too. I've had very bad luck this year. Aren't you afraid of getting into trouble?\" Mr.Gu shook his head like a drum in a child's hand and said, \"What nonsense! No way! Alas! What a lucky day! People who live in Shanghai are really drunk and dreaming. How did they know that going out was so dangerous? The mainland is a must. Let's find a restaurant to celebrate tonight, brother. \" We have a rest in the hotel and then go out for dinner. Li Meiting drank a few more glasses of wine, and everyone came back to life. He was just a reptile in beginning of spring, but now he is a reptile around the Dragon Boat Festival. He asked Miss Sun questions and told a lot of gossip.\r\nHsin-mei and Hung-chien were in the same room. After returning to the hotel, they were lying in bed chatting. Hung-chien asked Hsin-mei if he had noticed Li Mei-ting's ugly behavior towards Miss Sun. Hsin-mei said, \"I've always seen him as a lecher. He didn't wear crystal glasses when he went ashore. I paid attention to his eyes. It was white and black, and it was a sinister appearance. I heard my grandfather talk about it many times when I was a child. \" Hung-chien said, \"I'd rather he is lewd, but he is still popular, otherwise he is simply tasteless.\" Just then, I suddenly heard a woman's voice in Li Gu's room next door. It turns out that the walls of China hotels are thin and leaky. Although the body lives in this room, the ears are like those living in the next room. As usual, there are blind women smoking cigarettes in the hotel, lining up rooms to drum up business and asking guests to sing Shaoxing opera. Mr.Li was bargaining with them, and Mr.Gu knocked on the wall and invited Hsin-mei and Hung-chien to go to go to the opera. Hsin-mei said he could hear through the partition, but he couldn't come over. Mr.Gu said with a smile, \"This is too cheap for you. You have to pay for it. Ah ah! Gentlemen, this is a joke. \" At the same time, Hsin-mei and Hung-chien pouted and made faces, saying nothing. Hung-chien didn't sleep well last night, but he was tired again today. Although the next room was full of strings and songs, his sleep was dark. When he was under the hood, he slept until dawn, and he felt that the fatigue of his body was ironed out by sleep, just like the wrinkles and creases on his clothes passing through an iron. It suddenly occurred to him that it's not easy to be a real lovelorn, insomnia and hunger strike. The pain of the day before yesterday seemed to be so painful that the injured emotion was rooted out, and all the pain was brought up. Now he is stubborn and weak, and he has no spare capacity to grieve for Tang Xiaofu. Hsin-mei stretched out in bed and said, \"What a pain! After the Shaoxing opera next door, you snore. What a nuisance! You're lucky the roof didn't blow off your nose. I didn't fall asleep until dawn. \"",

I never snore. Maybe the person next door is snoring. You misunderstood me. You know, this wall is very fragile. \" Hsin-mei said angrily, \"You are such a scoundrel! You don't say that I snore by myself, and it's on you? I only hate that I couldn't ask someone from the record company to film your voice. \" If it is really made into a film, the sound will be loud, like a storm, like a wolf, with a little sharp and thin voice in the middle, high and low, and endless. Sometimes this thread goes up and up, so thin that it is like a full kite string that is about to break. Somehow, it crosses a peak and settles down again. Zhao Xinmei was so excited that he hung his nerves and fell off. At this time, he remembered and hated to break Hung-chien's nose and warned him to be careful next time. Hung-chien said, \"Well, don't settle accounts any more. I was tired yesterday, but you are so unforgiving. God will punish you for marrying a wife who snores like thunder and playing the trumpet at your pillow every night. \" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"To tell you the truth, I heard you snore yesterday, and I thought that one should be added to the selection criteria I told you on the boat: No snoring while sleeping.\" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"This can't be tested before we get married.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Please stop. I think a person snores and doesn't snore. I can see it in appearance. \" Hung-chien said, \"Of course. It is not a problem to marry a woman with a rotten nose. \" Hsin-mei jumped out of bed to twist Hung-chien's nose.\r\nThe journey that day was from Ningbo to Xikou, first by boat, and then by train. When they got on the boat, it began to rain slightly. Sometimes it's 1: 00 or 2: 00, like it doesn't belong to this side of the world. When you look closely, it's gone again. After a while, the rain became dense, but it was not like rain, just like many small drops of water were naughty in mid-air, rolling and jumping, naughty enough, and then landed. Hung-chien and others crowded on the bow of the boat to guard their luggage, and took out raincoats to wear one after another to get rid of Mr.Li, who said it was not raining hard and it was not worth opening the box to get the raincoat. The rain is getting older and older, and the water spots are running through the silk. The water vortex on the river is like acne and countless pockmarks, which goes out with life and never stops. The rain line is denser, and it seems that long hair is growing on the smooth water. Mr.Li cherished his newly bought raincoat and was reluctant to wear it on the trip, so he felt sorry for himself and said that he shouldn't put it at the bottom of the box. At this time, when he opened the box, his clothes would get wet. Miss Sun was very interested and said that she had a rain hat and lent him her small green silk umbrella. This umbrella was originally used by Miss Sun to cover the sun, for fear of crushing her bones in her luggage, so she often carried it in her hand. On the shore, Mr.Li went into the teahouse and put away his umbrella. Everyone was shocked and couldn't help laughing.",

On the shore, Mr.Li went into the teahouse and put away his umbrella. Everyone was shocked and couldn't help laughing. The green silk was discolored by the rain, and Mr.Li's face turned yellow and green, and there was a pool of green stains on his chest white shirt, like a residual manuscript of watercolor painting. Miss Sun blushed and hurriedly apologized. Mr.Li reluctantly said that it didn't matter, and Mr.Gu repeatedly asked the waiter to wash his face. Hsin-mei negotiated the price with the foreign rickshaw driver, and Hung-chien cherished the umbrella for Miss Sun, and distributed it to the waiter to squeeze the water and put it in front of the tea stove to dry. Mr.Li looked at the gray sky and said that the rain had stopped and there was no need to hold an umbrella on the road.\r\nAfter dessert, everyone gets on the bus. The waiter returned the umbrella to Miss Sun, and it was wet and steaming. It was already two o'clock in the afternoon, and a group of people urged the foreign rickshaw pullers to hurry. Within half an hour's walk, there was a steep stone slope, and the driver who pulled Mr.Li's big iron box slipped on the load road and couldn't hold his foot down the slope. He fell and the car overturned. Mr.Li jumped out of his car in such a hurry that he shouted, \"You broke the box,\" and called the driver a git. The driver pointed to his bloody knee and asked him to look at it, but he didn't speak. Very easy to send the driver and call another car. Go to the long bridge with rattan, and everyone gets off and walks. The bridge has no railings, and both sides collapse downward, which is a slender saddle shape. Hsin-mei jumped on the bridge first, took two steps, and then drew back, saying that his legs were weak. The drivers laughed at him and encouraged him. Mr.Gu said, \"Let me show you something.\" He calmly crossed the bridge, stood on the bridge embankment and called them over. Mr.Li perked up, took off his glasses and was careful step by step. When he got there, he called, \"Mr.Zhao, come here quickly. Don't be afraid. Miss Sun, do you want me to come back and help you cross the bridge? \" Hsin-mei has been very distant from Miss Sun since that night on the boat. At this time, he was deeply afraid of helping the poor, and he was duty-bound to be an \"uncle\". Let Hung-chien have this good job of chivalrous and soft-hearted, and he went over first in fear. Knowing Hsin-mei's intention, Hung-chien was so anxious that he secretly scolded himself for being timid. He was afraid that it would spoil things, so he had to smile at Miss Sun and say, \"There are only two cowards left.\" Miss Sun said, \"Is Mr.Fang afraid? I don't care. Do you want me to go ahead? You follow me, lest you look out, and the more empty you feel that the bridge can't be finished, the less courageous you are. \" Hung-chien can only appreciate it, thinking of a strange thing like a woman, and being considerate of people is really meticulous, and it is warm to her in the folds of sweat pores. After getting on the bridge, the slippery bridge deck sank slightly with the foot, and countless rattan cracks revealed deep dark green water. He ordered his eyes to look only at the back of Miss Sun's cheongsam, and did not dare to look at the side. Fortunately, when the bridge was finished, Miss Sun turned her face and smiled triumphantly.",

Hung-chien jumped off the bridge and shouted, \"You didn't go to hell, but you have been punished for leaving the Naihe Bridge! Is there such a bridge ahead? \" Gu Erqian was just about to say, \"You people who go abroad can't get used to China Road.\" Li Meiting asked him in a low voice on the stage if he had seen \"The Game of Articles\", which contained an eight-part essay on \"Helping a Little Girl Cross the Bridge\", which was wonderful. Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"Miss Sun, did you lead him ahead? Or is he taking care of you in the back? \" Hung-chien suddenly realized that people might not see that their cowardice was useless. There were two explanations for following Miss Sun, and he quickly said, \"Miss Sun led me across the bridge.\" This is the truth to Miss Sun, which is hard to argue with, while others only think that Hung-chien is being polite. Hung-chien's vanity forced him to cover up the truth; Miss Sun seemed to see through his intentions and just smiled and said nothing.\r\nIt was getting dark and the rain was coming, so the driver hurried on and said that the weather was going to change. The sky seemed to hear this sentence, and it boomed in the air, like dozens of bronze drums rolling on the floor of the Heavenly Palace. Since the morning, the air has been stuffy like an obstacle to breathing. Suddenly, there is a hole in the sky somewhere, and the cool air from the sky rushes in. The semi-yellow vegetation also wakes up from a daze, generally sighing and shivering, and the earth is like a steamer. The rain followed, cool and carefree, not like the rain in the morning, just like the sweat from the stuffy sky. It's raining harder and harder, just like a water point rushing to the ground. I can't wait to be ranked. I squeezed you, and you joined me to synthesize a whole piece of cold water, which was poured down mindlessly. The drivers ran a few steps to drag the wet skirts to the water on their faces. The heat generated by running could not resist the rain. They shivered and said to each other that they would like to drink some soju later, and asked the passengers to lift themselves up so that they could take clothes out from under the car seat. The passengers huddled up, only wishing that they had no clothes to add, and Mr.Li borrowed an umbrella from Miss Sun. The rain dyed the night, and the water was dark, and the sky was as dark as a moment. A group of people are walking in an ink bottle used for mechanical painting. It's so dark at night that I can't see my fingers! In this kind of night, ghosts have to touch their noses and turn corners, and cats will hate that their good beards can't be tentacles of insects. All the drivers have matches, but only two cars have lights. It is not easy to light a lamp in the dense rain. The matches are all wet, and even a few strokes only lead to a fire in my heart. The wilderness at this moment is like the world before Suiren was born. Hung-chien quickly called, \"I have a small flashlight.\" Open your suitcase and take it out, and shoot it at the ground. A circle of yellow light as big as the palm of your hand, countless rain moths rush to this aperture like fire. Miss Sun's flashlight shone brilliantly and dug a tunnel from the dark heart. So Hsin-mei got off the bus and asked Miss Sun for a flashlight, and told Hung-chien to get off, too. The two of them looked at each other in a staggered way, and the eight cars followed the lightning on the bank of the field like a funeral.",

The two of them looked at each other in a staggered way, and the eight cars followed the lightning on the bank of the field like a funeral. After walking for a long time, Li Gu got off and replaced them. When Hung-chien got back to the car, he was so tired that he dozed off. Suddenly he woke up and looked out with his eyes open. He was lying on the ground with white light, only to hear Mr.Li shouting. All the cars stopped. It turned out that Mr.Li walked with an umbrella in his left hand and a flashlight in his right hand, and his arm was sore. When he changed hands, he fell into the field and couldn't afford to struggle. Everyone pulled him up from the muddy water and asked him to take a bus. Hung-chien still showed the way. I don't know how long I've been walking, but I feel that the rain can't stop, the road can't go on, the shoes get heavier and heavier, and I'm so sleepy that I just keep walking mechanically and dare not stop, because once I stop, my legs can't walk any more. Hsin-mei also replaced Mr.Gu. Over time, when I arrived in the town, I invested in a village shop and developed a coachman. Four people took off their shoes, and the mud on them was worth the land scraped by corrupt officials. Li Mei-ting seemed to have taken a mud bath, and the other three people were spotted on the front and back of their trousers and on their vests, all covered with mud and tears. Everyone's tired eyes were pink with rain, and Miss Sun's lips were purple with cold. It stopped raining outside, and it was still windy and rainy in my head, and there was a sound. Hung-chien ate something hot, forced Hsin-mei to drink some soju, asked for hot water to wash his feet, and fell asleep. Hsin-mei was also very tired. He was afraid that Hung-chien's snoring would disturb him. He was worried. He suddenly hit him into the dark like a sleep sap, filtering out his dreams and having a pure and complete sleep.\r\nWhen I wake up, the weather is sunny as if nothing had happened. It just means that it will rain at night, and my face is sticky and hard, like toffee that is half-dissolved in summer, and it is easy to slip when walking. Everyone said that I was tired from walking yesterday, and my wet clothes were still wet. I have a day off and will go on the road tomorrow morning. Gu erqian's interest is like a cork floating in the water, and the downpour can't beat it, so he proposes to visit Xuedou Mountain in the afternoon. When Hsin-mei came back from a mountain tour, he inquired about the way to buy bus tickets. The innkeeper said that the ticket was very difficult to buy, so he had to go to the station to squeeze before dawn, and he couldn't buy it, unless the government officials with documents could bend the rules and buy tickets early. All five people have no papers, because they didn't expect to need it when they traveled. At that time, people who went deep into the mainland from Shanghai rarely took this road, and most of them transferred from Hong Kong to Kunming. So before they set off, they didn't hear anyone mention it, and they just followed Gao Songnian's journey. Miss sun is carrying her diploma, which is useless. Mr.Li went back to his room to open the box and took out a box of business cards. \"I don't know if this is a certificate?\" Everyone scrambled to read it, and there were three lines of titles on it: \"Director of National San Lv University\" and \"Director of Journalism Institute\", and one was a former secretary of a county party department.",

This film is hard in paper, quaint in font, and unambiguously printed by Juzhen Edition of Zhonghua Book Company. On the back is the cursive English word: \"professor may dinlea\" [3]. Mr.Li explained to the four people that the \"Journalism Institute\" was a cram school he had run in Shanghai with several friends. The words \"China Language Department\" in the first line of the title can be equal to the words in the second and third lines. Hung-chien asked him why he didn't use the foreign ready-made surname Lee. Li Meiting said, \"I asked my friend who is proficient in English and asked him to choose words with the same sound and meaning in English. Every word of China people's names has its own meaning. It makes no sense to spell out the letters. It is not easy for foreigners to remember them after reading them. For example, when foreign names are translated into Chinese,' George' is not as memorable as' George' and' Chicago' is not as memorable as' Poet Valley'. It is meaningful because of one syncopation and one syncopation. \" Mr.Gu nodded and sighed. Hsin-mei bit his teeth hard because he thought that \"Mating\" [4] and \"Mei Ting\" were homonyms, which was more meaningful. Hung-chien said, \"This film must be effective, and it will frighten the stationmaster of this highway. I will go with Mr.Li. \" Hsin-mei glanced at Hung-chien and said with a smile, \"You can't go like this. I'd better go with Mr.Li. I'll go up and change. \" Hung-chien hadn't shaved his beard and combed his hair for two days. Yesterday, his rain-soaked hair was knotted in the east and pricked in the west, and his suit was wet. He was wearing his father's old double robe, which was only knee-short, revealing a trouser tube with zero half a foot. Everyone smiled at Hung-chien. Li Mei-ting said, \"Hsin-mei is so proud! My dress is even worse, I'll try my best. \" His old flannel coat was soaked and baked to dry, which made it weak and swollen, adding to the wind paralysis; Trouser legs in the lower part of the body, plump and complete, without creases, can be on the ground in Li Zhuo without legs, like a pair of hollow national pillars; The wool-filled \"wrinkle-free tie\" was shrunk by water washing, and it was thin and curled up like the braid of an old man in the Qing Dynasty. When Hsin-mei changed his clothes and shoes, Mr.Li lamented his splendid night trip, and Mr.Gu was amazed. He also said, \"Thank you two, we attach\u00e9 s can only talk about it. It's really hard for those who can! I hope the two horses will succeed. \" Hsin-mei playfully said to Hung-chien, \"Stay with Miss Sun,\" and Hung-chien was at a loss for words. Miss Sun's blushing suddenly reminded him of the cold water when he was in France. I don't know how to drink, but I just make a little red wine in the water. I often watch this red liquid slouch in the white liquid, making it foggy, and the whole cup of water turns pale red in a moment. He thought that maybe the girl's mood when she had a boyfriend for the first time was like white water pouring red wine, not love, just a kind of mild excitement.\r\nHsin-mei and his wife didn't come back until more than an hour later. Li Mei-ting scowled and Hsin-mei smiled, saying that the stationmaster would reserve two tickets for tomorrow and three tickets for the day after tomorrow.",

Li Mei-ting scowled and Hsin-mei smiled, saying that the stationmaster would reserve two tickets for tomorrow and three tickets for the day after tomorrow. Who among the five would go first? As a result, it was decided that Li Gu and Li Gu would go to Jinhua first tomorrow. At dinner, Mei Ting drank a few glasses of wine before her face calmed down. It turned out that they went to the station to see the stationmaster, and it took a while for the person who delivered the film to get the stationmaster. He was sweating profusely. As soon as he arrived, he rushed Hsin-mei to call him \"Mr.Li\" and \"Director Li\", leaving Li Mei-ting alone. He also asked Hsin-mei if he would be the chief editor of the newspaper. Hsin-mei told him truthfully that he was an editor of Huamei News. The stationmaster said, \"that's a good newspaper, too. I often read it.\" There is something wrong with the management of our station. I hope Mr.Li will advise us. \" As he spoke, he wrote his name to Hsin-mei, implying that he was required to praise it in the newspaper. Hsin-mei couldn't help laughing when he told this story, saying that he had to pretend to be Mr.Li because of the ticket. Gu erqian said angrily, \"This snobbish kid only values clothes over people-of course, Mr.Zhao is also a famous figure in society, but Mr.Li doesn't have a suit like his, so he suffered a loss.\" Li Meiting said, \"It's not that I don't have new clothes, but the road is dusty, so I don't think it's worth wasting.\" Hsin-mei said quickly, \"Without this film of Mr.Li, no matter how new the clothes are, it's useless. Let's propose a toast to Mr.Li. \"\r\nTomorrow morning, everyone escorted Li Gu to the car. Mei Ting only cared about his big iron box, and when the car was about to leave, he also extended his head through the window to ask Hsin-mei and Hung-chien to see if it was on the roof. The porter just shook his head and said, there is a lot of luggage today, and this wolf can't put it down. He will arrive tomorrow. Anyway, the baggage ticket will not be delayed. Miss Sun quickly reported to Mr.Li that Mr.Li was frowning and giving orders. The car's head rumbled and tilted for a long time, and suddenly it was full of gas. Mr.Li shook his head and said something as if a hand had taken it away from his mouth and thrown it into the air. Miss Sun didn't hear it. Hung-chien watched the passengers' disturbance and crowding, worried about tomorrow, and only said, \"Li Gu is also crowded on the bus today, so we won't have a problem.\" Tomorrow, the three of them will get tickets, reward the porter who is in charge of luggage, and tell him to put their big luggage on this train, each with a small box in his hand, waiting for the bus in the crowd, always encouraging himself and not shrinking. When the first new car arrived, everyone swarmed into it, which proved that China was a brave man who dared to die, but he didn't go to the front. Seeing that there were too many people to squeeze in, Hung-chien wanted to rush to the second car coming at this time. Who knew that someone would always get ahead. Finally, all three of them got to the bus, had a foothold, breathed a sigh of relief, and smiled bitterly at each other before they had time to sweat. People keep coming. Desperate. Laughing softly, he said, \"Sorry, please squeeze!\" With great righteousness, he said, \"It's convenient for everyone to go out and get out.",

Ok! \" At present, he pointed out, \"Excuse me, my friend, there are plenty of places inside, so it's silly to stop at the door!\" \" Its threatening: \"I have tickets, why can't I get on the bus?\" Did you pack this car? Hey! \" As a result, all the people who bought the tickets got on the bus. I really didn't expect that the small car would be as elastic as it could accommodate many people. This carriage is like a sardine can, and the people inside are so tightly packed that their bodies are flat. However, the bones of sardines are deeply hidden in their own bodies, and the elbows and knees of these passengers are hard embedded in other people's bodies. The canned sardines are straight, and these passengers are curled up and twisted, with their waist and legs bent at a geometrically famous angle. Hsin-mei's box is too long to fit horizontally, so he can only sit upright in the aisle between the left and right rows of seats and sit on it by himself. Behind him was a small basket, on which sat the hostess smoking cigarettes. Hsin-mei turned around and asked her to smoke carefully so as not to burn people's clothes. Instead, she provoked the woman to say, \"You don't have eyes behind you, but my eyes are fine. I will never smoke on your pants, as long as you are careful not to hit your ass on my cigarette end.\" The woman's fellow villagers laughed with her. Hung-chien pushed his way forward, approached the bus driver and sat on the suitcase. Miss Sun had a seat on the wooden bench, but it was uncomfortable enough. The left and right men moved their thighs to make room for a corner, allowing only the small place where the monkey had its tail before it evolved into an adult to stick on the stool. When traveling, the horizon of life moves closer; It's only a few hours by car, and passengers seem to spend the rest of their lives in the car. As long as they sit still, their body and mind feel like they have a home, reading books, reading newspapers, smoking, eating and dozing once and for all. Things outside the journey are temporarily equal to things outside the body behind them.\r\nThe chauffeur put the things he brought privately and got into the car. This car has been through the dust for a long time, and it should celebrate its ancient age and longevity, but it retired before it was due to the Anti-Japanese War. The machine is not temperamental, and this car has grown into an unruly, eccentric and unpredictable character. Sometimes it is like a big bureaucrat, and sometimes it is awkward like a little girl. The rude drivers can't control it. When it started, it coughed at the front and was discouraged at the back, so it jumped up, causing the passengers to stagger and shout in unison. Miss Sun slipped off her seat, hung-chien hurt her head, and Hsin-mei almost fell backwards on the woman. The car was so loud that it walked for ten or twenty miles in one breath, and suddenly it had to rest, so the driver forced it to move on. If so, four or five times, this car realized that it is not a leisurely walk today, and it can wander around at will. It really has to walk, and the road ahead is still endless! He was angry and refused to leave, so the bus driver had to get off the bus and dredge the front of the car for a long time. He picked up a mass of mud by the roadside and invited him to enjoy it. He walked slowly like a drunk. Every time it refuses to leave, the chauffeur breaks his mouth and curses, and now he curses even more. There is only one meaning in swearing: the bus driver is willing to have physical love with the mother and grandmother of the car.",

There is only one meaning in swearing: the bus driver is willing to have physical love with the mother and grandmother of the car. Although there is no change in swearing, the strength of cursing is getting stronger and stronger. Behind the chauffeur sat a uniformed public servant and a girl of fifteen or sixteen, like father and daughter. Although the girl is young, the color of her face is better than the rainbow after rain, the sunlight under the prism or the colorful garden. The powder she rubbed was not imported, but seemed to be used by plasterers to whitewash the walls. The car jolted so badly that the powder particles on her face joined the dust flying in the sun. She listened to the chauffeur scold more and more frankly, and nature prevailed over labor, and the daubed red was radiant with shame and evil, so she whispered a word to Lao Tzu. The civil servant called the chauffeur and said, \"Friend, please be gentle. This is a female guest, ah!\" The chauffeur changed his face and was about to answer back. The officer and his wife who were sitting on the same bench with their father and daughter also said, \"What's the use of your scolding? The car will still break down. Your rude words stung people. \" The bus driver wanted to give up and say, \"I won't drive!\" On second thought, the civil servants and officers were all taken to the garage by the stationmaster to get on the bus and take good seats. They all had brand-new business purses. When I heard that the provincial government was on business, I couldn't beat them, so I had to endure anger and say to myself, \"I prefer to scold, it's none of your business! I'm afraid of stabbing my ear and stuffing it to be deaf! \" The driver lost his temper and drove more violently. He once narrowly hit a car coming from the opposite side. The officer's wife was afraid of smelling gasoline and gave the car a jolt, which made her sick. The strong breath in her mouth smelled of sour Shaoxing wine, rotten green onions and radishes. Hung-chien was also dizzy and his stomach was full. When he smelled the smell, he couldn't help it any more. He blurted out his vomit and quickly took out his handkerchief and held it down. I didn't eat anything in the morning, but I vomited only sour water. I couldn't suck my handkerchief, and my fingers popped out and poured it on my clothes. Fortunately, I didn't vomit much. I feel uncomfortable sitting, the box is too hard and too low, my body is embedded in the crowd, my feet can't stretch, my back can't bend, and it's not easy to change my sitting posture. I only sit on my left and right hips in turn for adjustment. I sit on my left for less than a minute, and my hip bones are sore, so I'm busy changing to my right, which is useless. A moment is like a moment, and I hardly believe that there will be a stop. However, after three times of tracing, I actually arrived at a small station. The bus driver was going to have lunch, and the guests went down to eat in a roadside restaurant. If Hung-chien and the other three were granted amnesty, they got out of the car, stretched themselves and exercised their legs. They lost their appetite for food, made a pot of tea and ate some biscuits brought in the box. Having a rest and having the energy to go back to the car to suffer, the bus driver said that the machine of this car was broken and had to be replaced. Everyone got on the original car, took their carry-on luggage and grabbed the second car. Hung-chien and others unexpectedly took good seats at the end of the car.",

Those people who had seats in the original car but don't have seats now all plausibly said: We should take the seats in the original car. The Republic of China is not a world of robbers, so don't talk about robbing. People who have seats are not only physically stable, but also psychologically dominant; They can look at those who have no seats coldly, while those who stand only look out of the window and have no courage to look back at them. This is a sick car, which is suffering from malaria. When you leave, the doors and windows all tremble, and the people sitting at the end of the car shake it to loosen the joints and turn the insides upside down. The japonica rice you just ate seems to jump in your stomach, like dice in a bowl in a casino. I didn't arrive in Jinhua until it was dark, and the luggage for the ticket was not moved from the original car, so I have to wait for the car to deliver it tomorrow. Hung-chien and others left the station wearily and went to a nearby small hotel for the night. Today's hard work is finished, and tomorrow's hard work is still far away. The physical and mental comfort of this night is to escape from the neutral time that does not belong to today and tomorrow.\r\nThe hotel is called \"Eurasia Hotel\". Although Europeans have not lived here until now, this name can be regarded as a prophecy, and it cannot be concluded that it is an exaggeration. There are two Chinese-style bungalows in the back, with five or six bedrooms separated by wooden boards, and a mat shed is set up on the yellow ground in front, which is regarded as a dining hall. It is necessary to lure passers-by in to stay with the smell of wine and meat, the ringing of cooking knives and pans and the shouts of waiters. The electric lights in the mat shed are brilliant, and red and green notes are plastered on the mud-plastered walls, which are written with the names of our specialty dishes, such as steamed turtle, local famous leg, three fresh rice noodles, milk coffee and so on. More than a dozen tables are occupied. At the desk where the shopkeeper writes accounts, a fat woman frankly spreads out her white but not frank chest and feeds her children. Milk is a meal for children, so it should be eaten in the dining hall, which proves that this hotel is scientifically managed. She is full of greasy nutrition, and children want to suck melted lard with sugar. She is so fat, which means that the food in this shop is also nutritious; She sits by the shopkeeper, which is a good advertisement. Hung-chien and others checked the room, washed their faces, went out for dinner, and found a table to sit down. The desktop is like Fan Jin's slap in the face of Hu Butcher in The Scholars, and he scraped a catty of lard. When everyone ordered food, Hung-chien and Miss Sun both said that they had a bad appetite and wanted to eat something light, so they each ordered a rice noodle. Hsin-mei doesn't like rice noodles, but wants a piece of three fresh and confused noodles. Suddenly, when Hung-chien saw the pink note of milk coffee, he said in surprise, \"I didn't expect this thing to be here. It's really a' Eurasia Hotel'! Let's have a drink to wake up our appetite first, and then another drink after dinner to be a European, shall we? \" Miss Sun is absolutely necessary. Hsin-mei said, \"I don't think it's delicious. Call the waiter to ask.\" The waiter's guarantee is a good thing from Shanghai, and it has never been opened. Hung-chien asked what brand it was, but the waiter didn't know what brand it was.",

Anyway, it was sweet and fragrant, scraping the goods on the top and making a cup in a packet. Hsin-mei suddenly realized, \"This is a coffee cube to trick children-\"Hung-chien said happily, \"Don't pay attention to it. Let's try three cups. There is always a smell of coffee.\" The waiter answered the phone. Miss Sun said, \"There is no milk in this coffee candy. How can it be called milk coffee? It must be added with milk powder.\" Hung-chien curled his mouth at the fat woman and said, \"Anything will do as long as it's not her milk.\" Miss Sun frowned and pouted to make a rather lovely expression of disgust. Hsin-mei blushed and laughed, \"Damn it! Damn it! You don't speak well. \" When the coffee came, it was dark and fragrant, with a layer of foam floating on the surface. Hung-chien asked the waiter what it was, and the waiter said it was milk. He asked what milk was and said it was cream of milk. Hsin-mei said, \"It looks like human spit to me.\" Hung-chien was about to drink, but he pushed open the cup in hatred and said, \"I don't want to drink!\" \" Miss Sun refused to drink either. Hsin-mei laughed and apologized, but she didn't drink it herself. She naughtily spat into the cup, which really looked like the floating foam. Hung-chien scolded him for spoiling things, but Miss Sun just laughed, like a mother watching her child make trouble and smiling with tolerance. The waiter served food and Hsin-mei's noodles. The noodles are badly cooked, greasy and sticky, like a bowl of paste, with some chicken neck bones and ham skins piled on them. Hsin-mei was very unhappy when he saw it. Hung-chien said with a smile, \"You said there was spit in your coffee. I think there is someone's nose in your bowl of noodles.\" Hsin-mei pushed the noodle bowl towards him and said, \"Please eat.\" I asked the waiter to exchange it, but the waiter refused, so I had to ask for another bowl of rice noodles. After finishing the accounts, Hsin-mei said, \"Today, we lost Li Meiting and Gu Erqian, and they scolded us to death for asking for something but not eating it. But I really can't eat this side, and I dare not study this rice noodle carefully. \" The oil lamp was lit in the bedroom, and when it was not bright outside, the three of them could not sit in and chat once. Everyone was a little tired and excited, and Miss Sun talked and laughed, but compared with Hsin-mei and Hung-chien's nonsense, the girl was more sophisticated.\r\nAt this time, a girl of three or four years old crawled into her hair with her hands and shouted to the fat shopkeeper. The fat woman patted the sleeping child in her arms with one hand and scratched the girl with the other. The five sausages born in her hand are very sensitive. When she grabs them in her hair, she catches a louse, strangles them, and makes the children spread out their palms and suffer from them. The girl pointed her other hand at the dead louse, and counted it in her mouth: \"One, two, five, eight, ten ...\" When Miss Sun saw it, she told Hsin-mei and Hung-chien that everyone felt itchy and went back to the bedroom to sleep. However, the scene just now made them wary of the bed.",

However, the scene just now made them wary of the bed. Miss Sun lent them a flashlight to take a photo on the bed, but the electricity ran out and she had to give up. \"Don't be afraid,\" said Hsin-mei. \"Tiredness will overcome all trivial matters. Sleep for one night.\" Hung-chien went to bed, and after a long while he had nothing to do, he was worried about going to sleep. Suddenly, he itched, which can't be ignored. One itched, two itches, itchy all over, and itchy in his heart. The \"Flea Market\" in Monmartre and the \"World Flea and Tick Conference\" in the Temple of Jerusalem are all held in this Eurasian Hotel. Bite it to pieces, and there is no strength in grasping it. Every fresh and clear itch, my fingers hold like thunder and lightning, and then I pick it up carefully, only to know that I didn't catch the biting little thing, and I wasted a lot of effort, just a small piece of skin between my fingers. It's easy to strangle a bug, just like being avenged. I feel at ease, feel at ease, and can sleep. Who knows, I still itch all over. Later, when I was exhausted and my self-awareness shrank, my body had to push myself out, learn from my Buddha's example of giving my life to feed the tiger, and do my best to benefit from those fleas and lice. Foreigners say that people with keen hearing can hear the cough of fleas; That night, these pointed ears should have heard that the fleas were full. I woke up in the morning, but I didn't eat all the fleas and lice. I cleaned up the wreckage and left enough meat to become an individual, but I didn't become a Buddha. I heard Hsin-mei screaming in bed, \"Good! Another one! Do you eat me comfortably? \" Hung-chien said, \"Are you talking to fleas or catching lice?\" Hsin-mei said, \"I'm killing myself. I caught two bedbugs and a flea, and they died, little by little red, all of which were my own blood. This doesn't mean suicide-hey, another one! Oh, it slipped away-Hung-chien, I'm surprised that there are so many blood-eating animals in this hotel, and the female shopkeeper can be so fat. \" Hung-chien said, \"Maybe these fleas and lice are kept by the female shopkeeper and let them suck the blood of the guests and supply them to her. I advise you not to catch it. Later, she told you to pay for it one by one. How come! Get up quickly and change hotels. \" Two people get up, take off their underwear, naked, cold and laughing, fingers along the seam of the clothes, shake the clothes and shake them, and then put them on. When I came out of the room, I met Miss Sun. There were some red spots on her face, and the smell of toilet water was fragrant. She also said that she had been itching all night. The three men went to the bus station \"message board\" and saw Li Guliu's note saying that they lived in a hotel next to the train station, so they moved. When settling accounts with the female shopkeeper, Hung-chien said that there were too many fleas in this shop. The female shopkeeper refused, saying that the beds in her shop were the cleanest, and that the bedbugs and fleas must have been brought with them by Hung-chien.\r\nLuggage is coming one after another. Today, a suitcase will be brought, and tomorrow, a bedclothes will be brought. Every afternoon, they have to go to the bus station to pick it up.",

On the fifth day, Li Meiting's iron box was still missing, and he was so anxious that he shouted and jumped, made two long-distance calls and finally came. Li Mei-ting quickly opened it to see if there was any damage to the contents. Everyone was happy for him, and they also took a look. The inside of the box is like a cupboard, each of which is a small drawer. Open the drawer; Inside are neatly arranged white cards, like a library catalogue. They burst into a strange voice, and Mei Ting looked angry and said, \"This is my magic weapon. As long as I have it, China's books have all been burned, and I can still open courses in the China Literature Department. \" These cards are arranged according to the four-corner number and are divided into two types: name and title. Curious, Hung-chien opened a drawer and flicked the card, only to see the word \"Du Fu\" written horizontally in red ink on the top of the film, the title written in purple ink below, and the text written in blue ink after the title. Hung-chien felt Mei Ting's white eyes staring at his expression in his black glasses, and said, \"Very fine! Great-\"knowing that his tone was not strong enough to coax Li Meiting, he quickly added,\" Mr.Gu and Hsin-mei, would you like to come and have a look? Really a scientific method! \" Gu Erqian said: \"I want Guang Guang's vision, and learning can't be learned!\" Not afraid of sour mouth and dry tongue, he repeatedly praised: \"Mr.Li, your pen calligraphy is also very vigorous, and you can write several characters in one hand, which is full of changes. I admire you!\" Mr.Li said with a smile, \"My handwriting is terrible. These films were written by my students under my guidance, and more than a dozen people wrote them.\" Mr.Gu shook his head and said, \"Alas! A famous teacher must make a noble apprentice! A famous teacher must be a noble apprentice! \" In this way, several drawers were opened up, down, left and right. Li Meiting said, \"It's all the same below. There's nothing to see.\" Gu erqian said, \"everything! I really wish I couldn't steal it-\"Li Mei-ting had no time to stop it. He had opened two drawers near the bottom of the box-\"Gee! This is not a card-\"Miss Sun leaned in and looked at it. She said uncertainly,\" It looks like western medicine. \" Li Meiting said coldly, \"This is western medicine. I have it for the road.\" Gu erqian's curiosity at this time made him not pay attention to his master's expression. He opened two drawers again, and a bottle was lying tightly in cotton, revealing a cork. Isn't it western medicine? Li Meiting couldn't help pushing Gu Erqian away. \"There's nothing missing. Let me close the box.\" Hung-chien said maliciously, \"No one will steal anything. I'm afraid the porter is clumsy and broke the glass bottle when throwing the box. You should check it carefully.\" Li Meiting said, \"I don't think so. I'm stuffed with cotton,\" and instinctively pulled the drawer. Half of this box is western medicine, and the original bottle is sealed with Xiaozhilong, Yaoteling, Cinchona Cream and Fumeida Tablets. Hsin-mei said, \"Mr.Li, you can't use all this by yourself! Did Kao Sung-nien ask you to bring it for the school? \" Mei Ting was like a drowning man.",

That's right Western medicine can't be bought in the mainland. If you get sick, then you will know my contribution to Li Meiting! \" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"Thank you in advance, thank you in advance! With the first half box of cards, China's books are burned out, and Mr.Li can teach China literature alone; With the second half of the box of medicine, all the people in China died of illness, and Mr.Li can still live. \" Gu erqian said, \"That's ridiculous! Mr.Li is not only the hero of the school, but also our savior-\"Adam and Eve lost their paradise for curiosity, and Gu Erqian also lost the paradise where Li Meiting laid him because of curiosity, and the compliment could not be redeemed. The following words sent him to hell-\"I have been cold and hot for the past two days, and my throat hurts a little-but it doesn't matter. When it comes to interest, I ask you to take three or five tablets of Famine. \"\r\nHsin-mei said that he had spent a lot of money in Jinhua for several days, so let's spread out the rest of our money and see how much it was. As he expected on the boat, Li Gu didn't bring all the travel expenses given by the school. At this time, the two men may have left a few yuan to guard their pockets for cigarette expenses, and only paid more than 50 yuan; Hsin-mei and the others each had more than 80 yuan left. I haven't paid my hotel bill yet, so I can't get to school anyway. We decided to send a telegram to Gao Songnian, asking him to remit money to the central bank in Ji 'an. Hsin-mei said that all the money we had on us should be used for public use before we arrived in Ji 'an, and not a penny should be wasted. Mr.Li asked about cigarettes. Hsin-mei said that cigarettes should not be bought in the future, and everyone should give up smoking. Hung-chien said, \"I gave up smoking long ago. Miss Sun doesn't smoke at all.\" Hsin-mei said, \"I smoke a pipe and take tobacco with me. I don't need to buy it on the way, but I won't smoke again, lest you be jealous.\" Mr.Li kept silent and suddenly said, \"I just bought two cans of cigarettes yesterday. Of course I can smoke on the way, as long as I don't buy any more.\" That evening, a group of five people bought a third-class ticket to get on the train in Jinhua, and they can go to yingtan early tomorrow morning. There are several passionate fleas and lice who are willing to travel far away to accompany them all the way.\r\nThe train arrived in yingtan early in the morning, and when the luggage was taken out, the bus left early. The only decent hotel in this town was listed as \"full\" and had to stay in a small shop. There are people living upstairs in this shop, and tea and rice are sold downstairs. There are houses on both sides of the narrow street, so the sun will not easily shine into the teahouse downstairs. On the table at the door, there is a pile of rice bowls and a few pieces of half-baked fat in a big plate. It used to be braised in brown sauce, but now it's like a red man's bad luck, cold and dark. Next to a plate of steamed bread, from a distance, it looks like a big girl who has defiled her innocence. It is full of black spots. As she approaches, these black spots soar and dissipate in the surrounding darkness.",

As she approaches, these black spots soar and dissipate in the surrounding darkness. It turns out to be flies. This thing, like mosquitoes and bedbugs, is three friends in a small restaurant. It's just late autumn now, and they still can't show their afterglow. There is only a bamboo ladder in the building, and Mr.Li's iron box can't be shipped up anyway. The shopkeeper patted his chest and promised to put it downstairs. Mr.Li had to console himself: \"For example, this box was delayed by the train and didn't arrive. The same family took care of it for me. I don't think things will leak. Didn't it take several days to arrive in Jinhua? \" Everyone praised him for being sensible. Hsin-mei went upstairs to see the bedroom accompanied by the staff. The floor was trampled by them and the dust fell down. Mr.Gu said with a smile, \"Mr.Zhao is really heavy!\" Seeing Miss Sun take out her handkerchief and brush the dust, the shopkeeper said, \"Don't worry, this floor is very solid. The floor should ring well, and guests will wake up when thieves come at night. The thief in our shop has never been here. He is afraid to come because our floor will ring. Scare! When the mouse moves, my floor will also report it. \" The man came down the stairs to greet the guests, and Li Meiting reluctantly entrusted the iron box to the shopkeeper. Only three rooms upstairs are still vacant, all of which are single beds. The man added a bamboo couch to Zhao Fang's room to calculate the price of double beds. Hsin-mei said, \"Our room is the best. It's along the street with the most light, and there are curtains on the bed. However, I don't want to sleep in the bedding in the shop. I have to find another way later. \" Hung-chien said, \"Why don't you give the nice room to Miss Sun?\" Hsin-mei pointed to the wall and said, \"Look.\" I saw the words in light ink written obliquely on the peeling white powder wall: \"Passing by yingtan and Ms. Wang Meiyu love each other, this is a permanent memorial to Jinan Xu Dalong.\" Remember the date of the Republic of China, and I wrote it last night. The back is also like Xu Dalong's ink. It is a poem: \"Wine is not intoxicating, people are intoxicated, people are fascinated, and today is destined to meet tomorrow.\" It also reads: \"Grandpa will go!\" The exclamation mark reminds people of Mr.Xu's impassioned manner, waving his whip, while leaving Beijing Opera in plain English. In addition, some small pencil characters are all about Wang Meiyu. Presumably, it was written by others before the night when Mr.Xu was drunk, because Mr.Xu's poems were written in the pencil characters \"Wang Meiyu in yingtan Palace was born with good beauty after being drunk\". There are three lines in pencil with new punctuation: \"Attention! Wang Meiyu is poisonous! During the anti-Japanese war, all my compatriots must be hygienic for the sake of building a healthy country and must not be contagious! And she only recognizes foreign money and has no feelings! Come on! \" Xu Dalong's comment on writing in light ink next to him said, \"What is the crime of damaging reputation?\" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"This Xu is very affectionate and righteous!\" Hsin-mei also said with a smile, \"Does Miss Sun live in this room? Li Mei-ting can't even stay-\"\r\nJust then, I heard Li Gu's face shouting. Mr.Gu was arguing with the man, and the two of them ran to look.",

Because all the bamboo couches in the shop were used up, the man put a plank door on two white wooden stools for Mr.Gu as his bed. When Gu Erqian saw Hsin-mei and Hung-chien, he was so excited that he bared his teeth and said, \"Do you think he is hateful? This is for dead bodies. Isn't he bullying me? \" The man said, \"This is the only board in the shop. You civilized people in suits should be reasonable.\" Gu erqian patted himself on the chest of his blue cloth gown and said, \"I'm unreasonable if I don't wear a suit? Why do others have bamboo beds to sleep on and I don't? I don't pay the same? I'm not superstitious, but I'm trying to make a profit when I go out. You guys don't know the rules at all. \" Since the discovery of western medicine yesterday, Li Mei-ting has not been very protective of Gu Erqian, watching them quarrel coldly, and then interjected, \"Just move this board. What are you arguing about? You try to carry my box up, which can be used as a bed. I'll treat you to a cigarette. \"The index finger of the left hand shook as if it were a cigarette sample. The man looked at the yellow finger, not the cigarette, and just looked at it and said, \"Where are the cigarettes?\" Li Meiting shook his head and said, \"Hum, you are so stupid! I naturally have cigarettes, and I will lie to you? You bring my iron box up and I'll ask you to smoke it. \" The man said, \"If you have a cigarette, give me one. If you really want me to move the box, that won't work.\" Mr.Li was so angry that he had to laugh. Mr.Gu successfully taught everyone that this guy was unreasonable. As a result, the bamboo couch where Hung-chien slept was switched with this door.\r\nWhen Miss Sun came, Hsin-mei asked where to have breakfast. Li Meiting said, \"It's in our shop. You don't have to go to the streets to find it. Maybe it's cheaper. \" Hsin-mei couldn't make any suggestions, so the waiter just came up to make tea and asked him what he had to eat in the shop. The man said there were big white steamed bread, four-happiness meat, eggs and wind meat. Hung-chien advocated cutting a dish of meat with steamed bread to eat, but Li Gu and Zhao agreed, saying it was a \"local culture sandwich\" and had to hand it over to the guys to prepare. Miss Sun said, \"When I came in, I saw that this shop was full of flies, and the steamed bread and meat were stung by flies. I'm afraid it was not hygienic.\" Li Mei-ting said with a smile, \"Miss Sun, after all, is pampered by a boudoir. I didn't know the journey was difficult. If you want to find a hotel without flies, you can only go abroad! I promise you won't get sick if you eat it, but you will get sick. I have plenty of medicine in my box, \"he said, grimacing, which is more suitable than his original face.\" Hsin-mei was drinking the newly brewed boiling water in Li Meiting's room, and took a sip. He frowned and said, \"The more you drink this water, the more thirsty it becomes. It's full of fireworks, and it can replace kerosene for lighting. I don't think things in this shop are reliable. It's only winter, and it's only autumn. I know what kind of antique this wind meat is.",

Let's not order food first, let's go down and investigate before we decide. \" The man took off a piece of black and greasy thing hanging on the wall and invited them to appreciate it. He even said, \"It's delicious!\" \" It made my mouth water, for fear that the fat would lose weight after the greedy eyes of these guests. A maggot on the meat woke up from a greasy sleep, crawling and curling. Li Meiting's eyes were quick and he felt sick. He pointed his mouth at a distance and made a sign: \"This is unacceptable!\" The man quickly put his finger on this tender, fat, soft and white thing, gently pressed it, and drew a dark and oily trace on the dirt on the meat surface, like a newly poured asphalt road, saying, \"Nothing!\" Gu erqian was furious and repeatedly questioned him: \"Are we blind?\" Everyone also said, \"How dare you!\" Gu erqian also nagged about the bed board. The noise made the shopkeeper come, and two other maggots in the meat also heard the sound probe appear. The man couldn't destroy the corpse any more, but repeatedly said, \"If you don't eat, someone will eat-I'll show it to you.\" The shopkeeper pulled out the pipe in his mouth and advised, \"It's not a bug, it doesn't matter, it's called granulation-meat-bud.\" Fang Hung-chien extended, \"Everything you eat in this shop will germinate, not just meat.\" The shopkeeper didn't understand, but he was angry when he saw everyone laughing, and muttered to the waiter in dialect. As a result, five people went out to eat in that decent hotel.\r\nLi Meiting's film didn't have much effect. The bus stationmaster said that only by registering according to the rules, there must be tickets after three days in order. Five people are in a panic: three days' room meals are a good expense. If we delay like this, we are afraid that our money will not reach Ji 'an. Everyone listlessly walked back to the inn and saw a woman leaning against the door smoking. This woman's face is sharp and cheeky, and I don't know what to use to iron out a head of curly hair, like plum blossoms in China's freehand brushwork, a white silk scarf around her neck, and a green silk cheongsam on her body, which is dazzling, but her face is as bright as the lining of a small woman's cheongsam. Hsin-mei patted Hung-chien on the arm and said, \"I'm afraid this is' a beautiful jade in Sri Lanka'.\" Hung-chien smiled and said, \"I think so, too.\" Gu erqian listened to them recite the Analects of Confucius, but he didn't understand the meaning and asked, \"What?\" Li Meiting was clever and said, \"Er Qian, why do you think there are women dressed like that in this place-why do you recite the Analects of Confucius?\" Hung-chien said, \"Come to our room and have a look.\" Gu erqian heard that she was a prostitute, but she just looked at Miss Sun from head to toe. Suddenly, she found Mr.Gu's attention and smiled at him. Her mouth was full of bright red root meat, and the block was uneven like a knight's mind, with a few yellow teeth that were shy and refused to show her head. Mr.Gu blushed with shame. Fortunately, no one saw him, so he hurried into the shop with Miss Sun. Hsin-mei and Hung-chien didn't sleep well in the train all night. They went back to their rooms to lie down and rest.",

Li Meiting knocked at the door and came in, asking if there was anything good to show him. They were lazy to get up and told him to read the literature on the wall by himself. Li Mei-ting looked out of the window again and shouted back, \"You two young people are up to no good! No wonder you want to occupy this room. It must be Wang Meiyu's bedroom opposite, only four or five feet away, and you can jump over it. Get up and look, there is a red quilt on the bed, a big mirror on the table, and perfume bottles-alas! You unmarried people are so dishonest. This is no joke-hey, she's coming up! \" Two people give him a look from the bed, and sure enough, the woman who was leaning against the door smoking stood against the window and hurriedly went to sleep. As if nothing had happened, Mr.Li smoked with his head held high by the window, admiring the opposite roof through his black glasses. They were impatient in bed and were about to ask Li Meiting to go out when suddenly they heard the woman say, \"Where did you get what?\" Mr.Li jumped like a dream and said, \"Who are you asking? Me? We are from Shanghai. \" This is not ridiculous, but the two laughed and covered their heads, and quickly uncovered the quilt, to listen to the following. The woman said, \"I'm from Shanghai, too. I've fled here-what do you do?\" Mr.Li subconsciously reached into his pocket for the film, realized it, and said with dignity, \"We are all university professors.\" The woman said, \"A teacher? Teachers don't have money, so why don't they smuggle it? \" The two men were covered again. Mr.Li only answered in his nose. The woman said, \"My father also teaches-\"They laughed with their heads covered and cried out in pain-\"Who's that woman with you? She teaches, too? \" Mr.Li said, \"Yes.\" The woman said, \"I went to school, too-how much does she earn?\" Hsin-mei was afraid that the woman would laugh at Miss Sun for not making as much money as her and cough loudly. Mr.Li only said, \"A lot, a lot-have a cigarette?\" Which, well-\"two people are too nervous to breathe out, Mr.Li's following words make them unable to believe their ears-\"I ask you, bus tickets are hard to buy, you-you know many people, is there any way to think of one? We thank you well. \" The woman made a long speech, which was quick and crisp, like cutting radish slices with a steel knife. The main idea was: you can't buy a road ticket, you can take a military freight car. She knows a battalion commander Hou and will come to see her later. At that time, Mr.Li will go to meet face to face. Mr.Li thanks a thousand Xie Wan. When the woman left, Mr.Li turned around and turned his head proudly to Zhao Fang and looked at them without saying a word. Both of them admire his whimsy and real ability. Mr.Li wished he could not incarnate, patted his shoulder and said, \"Lao Li, you are really there!\" \" Therefore, I am not modest to say: \"I know that such women have many ways and sometimes need them. This is the intention of Meng Changjun to make friends with chickens and dogs.\"\r\nAfter Mr.Li left, Hsin-mei and Hung-chien fell asleep.",

In his sleep, Hung-chien felt that something was bumping into this dense sleep, only a small hole was broken, and the whole sleep was scattered, injecting into the ice like boiling water. When he woke up, he only heard: \"Kuang! Hey! \" When I got out of bed in a daze, I saw that Wang Meiyu was calling to this side and was about to close the window and ignore her. Suddenly I remembered Li Meiting's contact with her. Hsin-mei woke up, too. Wang Meiyu said, \"What about the one with black glasses? Hou Yingchang is here. \" When Li Mei-ting was informed, she quickly took out the suit, trousers and tie pressed under the mattress. She had shaved her face, and her skin was broken in several places, but her face was red. Before leaving, Li Meiting said that prostitutes can't go to their homes for nothing, but they have to spend money. How to calculate this communication fee? She has just lost a cigarette. Everyone guarantees him that as long as the negotiation goes smoothly, he will not only bear the cost, but also be paid. Li Mei-ting asked them if they wanted to sit in through the window in Hsin-mei's room. \"Anyway, there's nothing secret.\" Others have no such pleasure, saying that it is now four o'clock, strolling in the streets, and meeting at the breakfast restaurant at six o'clock. At that time, Li Meiting came excitedly. Everyone asked quickly how things were going, and Li Meiting said, \"We will drive at noon tomorrow.\" Everyone is still asking questions. Li Meiting said that the battalion commander Hou would come to see his luggage at nine o'clock in the evening, and he could ask questions face to face. Each of these military trucks carries one passenger and one or two pieces of luggage. They drive to Shaoguan and then take the train to Hunan. The cost is twice as expensive as taking a bus. \"But,\" Li Meiting said, \"waiting for bus tickets everywhere is a few days, and the room has saved money.\" Hsin-mei hesitated and said, \"Good is good, but what about the money remitted by the school to Ji 'an?\" Li Meiting said, \"That's easy. Just send a telegram and ask President Gao to remit it to Shaoguan.\" Hung-chien said, \"Isn't it a long way to go back to Hunan in Shaoguan?\" Li Meiting said abruptly, \"My ability is limited, and I can only do this. Mr.Fang has a face. Maybe battalion commander Hou will send a special car to the school for you. \" Gu erqian said quickly, \"Mr.Li can't do anything wrong. Send a telegram early tomorrow morning and get on the bus at noon. Damn it, you have to teach me to wait in this hellhole for five days, and my hair is white. \" Li Mei-ting also said angrily, \"I will pay for Wang Meiyu's tea party today.\" Hung-chien swallowed his breath and said, \"Even if you don't take a military vehicle, everyone should pay for the communication. This is absolutely different.\" Hsin-mei kicked Hung-chien under the table and talked nonsense for a while. At last, there was no quarrel between the two sides, and Miss Sun's wide eyes returned to normal.\r\nNot long after returning to the hotel, the man shouted with a meal in his mouth under the ladder: \"Hou Yingchang is here!\" \" Everybody get down. Battalion commander Hou has a big orange nose with a face attached to it. He has everything on his face, but he doesn't squeeze his eyebrows.",

Battalion commander Hou has a big orange nose with a face attached to it. He has everything on his face, but he doesn't squeeze his eyebrows. He has a few wine thorns on his nose, like an unripe strawberry, laughing loudly, and he is a hero at a glance. When Battalion Hou saw Li Meiting, he said with a smile, \"Why did I go back to Xiao Wang, and you already ran away? When did you leave? \" Li Mei-ting faltered and introduced the three colleagues, but Miss Sun hasn't come down yet. Battalion commander Hou said, \"We can't take guests privately in this van, but it's against the military law to take guests. Do you understand? But I see that you are teaching in a national school, and you are also civil servants at last, so take the risk to be convenient, understand? I don't want any money from you, and you are also very poor. I don't care about this money, understand? But my brother who is driving and riding a car wants some cigarette money, and you can't take it out without it, understand? I don't want money, do you have much luggage? There's no contraband from Shanghai, is there? Haha, you scholars are sometimes very greedy and cheap! \" Laughing, the muscles in both cheeks pulled the nostrils bigger. Everyone said in unison that there was no contraband. Li Meiting pointed to his iron box and said, \"This is a piece of luggage, and there is something upstairs.\" Battalion Hou's eyes suddenly became nearsighted. After staring at it for a long time, he seemed to see clearly. He said like a machine gun, \"Good guy! Whose is this? What's in it? I can't take this-\"Suddenly I'm nearsighted again, and I open my eyes and look at Miss Sun who just came down the stairs-\"Did you go with me? I can't take this-this either. I didn't say a few words to you just now, so I was called away. I didn't explain it clearly, and the woman didn't bring it. If a woman could take it, I would have taken Xiao Wang 121 and left, haha. \" Miss Sun was so angry that she became silent. When Hung-chien waited for the battalion commander to enter the opposite door, he shouted at his ruined broad back, \"Asshole!\" Hsin-mei and Mr.Gu advised Miss Sun not to mind. \"Such people have no good words in their mouths.\" Miss Sun said, \"I'm the only one who prevented you from getting a ride-\"Hung-chien said, \"And Mr.Li, a treasure chest! Mr.Li, you-\"Li Meiting apologized to Miss Sun,\" I didn't do a good job, and you were insulted. \" Having said that, Hung-chien couldn't hurt him.\r\nWhen it didn't work out, Li Meiting was the first to say \"lucky\" and said, \"It's a blessing to lose your horse.\" If people with guns are unreasonable, we will go with Miss Sun, so we should be careful. Moreover, when I went to Shaoguan to Hunan, I took too many roads and spent too much money. Mr.Fang was absolutely right. \" During these days in yingtan, Li Mei-ting was particularly attentive to Hung-chien, but the more he disliked him, he said with a smile behind his back to Hsin-mei, \"I'm afraid I'll be picky about the few dollars I spend on tea, so I have no ambition. I have done him and would rather pay for it. \" When Hung-chien couldn't sleep at night, he felt sorry for himself, and the more he thought about it, the more he regretted coming this time.",

It is shameful to associate with Li Meiting, Gu Erqian and others. These ten days of travel have worn down one's ambition. One day when he was walking with Hsin-mei, he heard a peanut vendor speak his hometown dialect. When asked, he was indeed a fellow countryman and had fled and lived here. The peddler simply said that he lived in the street in the county town, and he didn't complain to him. When he borrowed money from his hometown, Hung-chien was relieved and sighed with emotion, \"This man must have touched the nails of many fellow villagers, so he stopped talking. I really don't dare to think about how many setbacks I have experienced before I can hone this kind of unswerving realm. \" Hsin-mei laughed at his depression and said, \"You can't stand the blow like this, and you won't succeed in your lifelong love.\" Hung-chien said, \"Who is willing to spend twenty years on Miss Su like you?\" Hsin-mei said, \"I've been bored these days, too. I woke up in the middle of the night last night and suddenly wondered if Su Wenwan would think of me sometimes.\" Hung-chien thought of Tang Xiaofu and himself, and his heart jumped up like a flaming tongue and said, \"Thinking of you or missing you? We have to think of countless people a day, relatives, friends, enemies, and unrelated people we have met. It is rare to really miss someone, miss him and hope to be close to him. Personnel are too busy, and we are not allowed to concentrate on missing someone without interruption. I'm afraid our thoughts about the dearest person in our life add up to less than one o'clock, and besides, we just glanced at him and thought about it. \" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"I always hope that you will give it to me in a few seconds in the future. To tell you the truth, after I first met you, I often missed you and hated you for a long time. Unfortunately, I didn't look at my watch and count the time. \" Hung-chien said, \"You see, rivals miss each other more than lovers miss each other-maybe Miss Su was really dreaming about you at that time, so you suddenly thought of her.\" Hsin-mei said, \"People don't have time to dream about ghosts like us. And she is already a Cao Yuanlang. To dream that I am unfaithful to her husband. \" Seeing his seriousness, Hung-chien laughed himself down and said, \"What a dictatorial politician you are! Whoever is your wife can't be free even in a dream. You should send secret service staff to spy on her subconscious. \"\r\nThree days later, the road bus to Nancheng was as usual crowded, and all five people stood in the crowd and comforted each other: \"It will take half a day to get to Nancheng. It doesn't matter if you stand for a while.\" A man with short clothes and a full face of oil spread out his knees, sitting firmly in his seat as if he were a part of the car, with a round sack in front and rice in it. This sack is as high as a seat, just beside Miss Sun. Hsin-mei said to Miss Sun, \"Why don't you sit down? Much more comfortable than sitting. \" Miss sun also felt uneasy about standing, apologized to the oily man and asked to sit down. The oily-faced man jumped up straight, stopped with his hands, rolled his eyes and shouted, \"This is rice, do you know it?\" Eat rice! \" Miss Sun was too embarrassed to speak. Hsin-mei scowled at each other and said, \"So what if it's rice? A woman like her won't crush your rice if she sits down. \"",
        "ff5c7999-d278-4b55-a125-858c1e4acc04": "It doesn't matter if you stand for a while.\" A man with short clothes and a full face of oil spread out his knees, sitting firmly in his seat as if he were a part of the car, with a round sack in front and rice in it.

You have to eat rice in your mouth.\" Miss Sun stamped with shame and indignation, \"I don't want to sit down! Mr.Zhao, ignore him. \" When Hsin-mei refused, Fang Ligu and the other three joined in the quarrel, calling the man insolent, occupying his seat and obstructing others with rice bags. Since people were not allowed to sit in rice bags, they quickly gave up their seats. Seeing how strong they were, the man softened his attitude and said, \"You men can sit, but you ladies can't! This is rice, which is eaten in the mouth. \" Miss Sun declared for the second time that she was willing to stand all the way to Nancheng. Hsin-mei and others said, \"We don't want to sit down. This young lady wants to sit down. What about you?\" Unable to do so, the man glared at Miss Sun, took out the small clothing bag that he was sitting on, picked up a pair of semi-old cotton trousers, covered it with a rice bag, put on a gas mask for rice, and said sharply, \"Sit down!\" Miss sun didn't want to sit, but she couldn't stand the turbulence of the car and everyone's advice, so she sat. There is a young white woman sitting diagonally opposite Miss Sun, with filial piety, but her lips and eyelids are red, her eyebrows are fine, her eyes are small, and her facial features are as plain as a hot towel. When she talks, she turns her head and pouts. She was watching the fun, and now she talked with Miss Sun. She asked Miss Sun if she was from Shanghai in Suzhou dialect, and called the mainlanders fierce and rude, and ignored them. She said that her husband was a clerk in the Zhejiang provincial government and died of illness. She went to Guilin to join her husband and brother. Knowing that Miss Sun had four people with her, she was very envious and said to herself, \"I'm lonely, and I only have one servant to accompany me on the way, so I'm not as lucky as you!\" She also expressed her willingness to go to Hengyang together and have a care. Just as the talk was lively, the bus stopped and hit the early tip, and most of the guests got off and had breakfast. The woman didn't get off the bus, opened her basket, and forced Miss Sun to eat the rice cake she brought. Zhao Fang, fearing that it would be difficult for the widow to share the cake, got off the bus and went for a walk. Gu erqian look at them, took out half a cigarette smoking. Li Mei-ting looked around for a few people and said to the widow, \"At that time, you shouldn't have said that you were a widow traveling alone. There were many bad people on the road and many eyes and ears in the car. After listening to your words, you would have evil thoughts.\" The widow rolled her eyes at Li Mei-ting and pulled her mouth. \"Mr.Mao is really a good man!\" The woman called the man in his twenties sitting on her left and said, \"Ah Fu, let this gentleman sit down.\" This man is slick, like a loquat seed soaked in oil, wearing a blue cloth coat and sitting side by side with a woman. You can't see that he is a servant. Now he reveals his identity to a woman and wants to give up his seat, so he has to stand up with his mouth open. Mr.Li pretended to be polite, so he sat down and was wiped.",

Mr.Li pretended to be polite, so he sat down and was wiped. Miss sun couldn't see it, so she got off the bus. When everyone gets back to the car and the bus is on the road, Mr.Li is chewing rice cakes, and the widow and Ah Fu are smoking cigarettes. Hung-chien said to Hsin-mei in English, \"Guess whose cigarette this is?\" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"What don't I know? This man is a liar. He hasn't finished smoking those two cans of cigarettes yet. I really don't believe it. \" Hung-chien said, \"His cigarette smells bad. Now he smokes with three mouths at the same time. I can't stand it. I have to wear a gas mask. Please smoke your pipe for a while to relieve his tobacco poison. \"\r\nArriving in Nancheng, the widow's master and servant stayed in a hotel with the five of them. According to Li Mei-ting, Miss Sun shares a room with the widow, while Ah Fu sleeps alone. Miss Sun said that she would never keep the widow company, but Li Mei-ting repeatedly indicated that there was not much money left, so she could save money on hotel expenses. Without asking Li Meiting for permission, the widow opened a room for the master and servant. Everyone was surprised, especially Li Meiting, who was filled with indignation. He muttered behind his back for a long time: \"Men and women are different, and there are points of honor and inferiority.\" Gu erqian borrowed a newspaper of the day, but he didn't like a few lines and shouted, \"Oh, no! Mr.Zhao, Mr.Li, it's bad! Miss Sun. \" It turned out that the Japanese attacked Changsha and the situation was very critical. After discussion, the five of them felt that the expenses on their bodies were definitely not enough to be returned. They had to get to Ji 'an and receive the remittance, depending on the situation. Li Meiting hurried to tell the widow the urgent news of Changsha, adding oil and sauce, as if the Japanese military department had given him confidential information, which scared the woman to say, \"Oh, dear!\" Mr.Li, what a shame! \" Li Meiting said that a gentleman like himself has ways everywhere, and he can act according to the camera to save his life. \"People can't be relied on without knowledge-he won't be a servant if he has knowledge!\" Follow him, and you will be in trouble. \" Li Meiting said goodbye to the widow a little while later, only to hear Ah Fu's harsh voice in her room: \"Section Chief Pan sent me to see you off. You met a good one on the way. Do you know who he is? How can I explain to Pan Kechang in the future? \" The woman said, \"Is it your turn to be jealous? I want you to take care of it? Give you some face and you'll be king! Ungrateful and ungrateful bastard! \" Ah Fu sneered, \"Who picked me to be the tortoise? It's not enough for you to be a bastard, but it's also going to hurt me-alas-\"and ran out of the room. The woman screamed in the room, \"I slapped you in the face and taught you to burn the road head to me!\" You are presumptuous, please taste it, and don't think about it next time-\"Mr.Li listened to their words for a reason, and made a sour heart like a wringing juice, wishing he could ask the widow a clear answer and beat Alfred up again. He fidgeted and looked out. Ah Fu was hiding outside the widow's room, stroking his swollen cheek with his left hand. He caught a glimpse of Li Meiting and said to himself, \"Don't look at your face in the urinal!",
        "b412a3d7-5096-4dae-93d4-8998bb226c2d": "Ungrateful and ungrateful bastard! \" Ah Fu sneered, \"Who picked me to be the tortoise?

He caught a glimpse of Li Meiting and said to himself, \"Don't look at your face in the urinal! I want to hang my arms and steal money-\"Mr.Li couldn't resist any more self-restraint, and rushed out of the room:\" Pigs! Who are you cursing? \" Ah Fu said, \"Call you a pig.\" Mr.Li said, \"The pigs called me names.\" Ah Fu said, \"I scold pigs.\" The syntactic practice of \"chicken lays eggs\" and \"egg lays chicken\" has no end. Anyway, whoever has a high voice is the truth. Mr.Gu was afraid of things, so he pulled Mr.Li in and said, \"What does this little man care about with him?\" Ah Fu said with a hundred times power and prestige, \"You have the guts to come out! Don't hide in the hole like a turtle, I'm afraid of you-\"Mr.Li is really going to make a dash for the door again, but Hsin-mei and Hung-chien can't stand it, and they also come out to drink Ah Fu.\" People ignore you, why are you still unclear? \" Ah Fu was a little discouraged, but he insisted, \"Joke! What I scold is none of your business. \" Hsin-mei's pipe in his mouth was sticking up like a cannon on an old warship. He wiped his palm, clapped it crisply and held his fist. \"What if I look on and feel aggrieved?\" Ah Fu's eyes were full of fear, but before Hsin-mei finished, the widow jumped out of the room and said, \"Who dares to bully my servant? Two deceives one, shameless! It's no use being a man and bullying my widow! \" Hsin-mei and Hung-chien hurried away. The widow sneered proudly, scolded by the sea, and La Afu went back to her room. Hsin-mei taught Li Mei-ting a lesson. Hung-chien said to Hsin-mei behind his back, \"When the tigress jumped out, it was Miss Sun's turn for us.\" In the second half of the day, the widow met the five of them and pretended to ignore them. Ah Fu winked at Li Meiting regardless of the face from the grave. The widow has something to call \"Ah Fu\", and there is honey dripping in her voice. Li Meiting sighed at midnight.\r\nThe hotel stayed another day. On this day, Miss Sun nodded and smiled when she met the widow. If Hsin-mei and others were not around, maybe they would exchange a few words of entertainment, saying that tickets were hard to buy and the hotel was stuffy. However, Hsin-mei and the other four people seemed to have learned the stealth method newly. The widow met them on the road and didn't look at them. When I get on the bus tomorrow, Hsin-mei and others have checked all their luggage, and there are few things to carry, so they all grab seats when they squeeze in. Widows carry some small luggage that doesn't pay the bill; When Ah Fu got on the bus, he was just like an important person holding hands with the guests at the welcome meeting. I wish I could share a few hands with Avalokitesvara. Seeing that there were no seats for them, Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"It's a pity that we fell out yesterday, otherwise we would have to give up our seats at this time. I won't.\" The word \"I\" was said meaningfully, and Li Meiting blushed, and everyone held back their laughter. The widow looked at Miss Sun from a distance, reminding her of the stare of an ox or a horse asking for help, because eyes are the tongues of dumb animals.",

Miss Sun relented and looked down, but she felt uneasy about sitting. It was not until the car drove away that she saw that the widow had a seat.\r\nThe bus will arrive in Ningdu in the afternoon. Hsin-mei and his colleagues were busy collecting their luggage. Please be careful. Two pieces have not arrived. They all said, \"Bad luck! I don't know how many days it will be. \" I'm worried about money. When I went to the hotel opposite the station, there were only two double bedrooms left. Hsin-mei said, \"How can this be done? Miss Sun has one room for each person, and a single bed is enough. The four of us need two rooms. \" Miss Sun said without hesitation, \"It doesn't matter to me. Just add a bamboo shop to Mr.Zhao's room. Wouldn't it save trouble and money?\" I looked at the room, put things aside, and settled the bill for today's trip. Everyone said that dinner was just about to be called, but suddenly a room shouted, \"Dude! Dude! \" It was the widow's voice, coughing and choking, that started a big fight. After listening carefully, the widow ordered the food in the hotel, and she felt sick when she couldn't eat a few chopsticks. Only then did she know that the food was fried with tung oil. Ah Fu, a coarse product, ignored the taste and swallowed two bowls of rice in one breath, even spitting up the food. \"I spit out all the food I ate overnight!\" \" The widow said, as if the meal she had in Nancheng should have been taken to Guilin. Li Mei-ting clapped his hands and said, \"It's a godsend to punish him. Look at this bastard who wants to run wild. There is no need to ask for food in this hotel. They have already made experiments for us. \" When five people went out of the hotel, the widow's door was wide open, and Ah Fu was whining on the bed. She held the table and felt sick at the spittoon. The man took a cup of boiling water in one hand and patted her on the back in the other. Mr.Li said, \"Gee, she threw up, too!\" Hsin-mei said, \"Vomiting is as contagious as yawning. Especially when you are seasick, you can't see people vomiting. \" Miss Sun bent her smiling eyes and said, \"Mr.Li, you have medicine for calming the stomach nerves. Give her one, and she will-\"Li Meiting pretended to jump in the street and shouted, \"Miss Sun, you are so bad! You're making fun of me, too. I told your uncle Zhao. \"\r\nIn the evening, Hsin-mei and the others gave in to the question of who would sleep on the bamboo couch. Miss Sun forced Hsin-mei and Hung-chien to sleep in bed, as if this was not a woman's right, but her duty. Hsin-mei is too tall for a bamboo couch. As a result, Hung-chien slept on a bamboo couch, just sandwiched between two beds, and lay down. He was so embarrassed that he just wanted to toss and turn, but he was too stiff to move. After a while, he listened to Hsin-mei's breathing and was expected to be fast asleep. He wanted to take advantage of this guy and fell down between these two beds without hanging curtains, making a screen to isolate Miss Sun for him. He felt that the oil lamp on the table was too bright. He endured it for a while, could not bear it, got out of bed gently, wanted to have a drink of Leng Cha, blew out the lamp and went to sleep.",

He felt that the oil lamp on the table was too bright. He endured it for a while, could not bear it, got out of bed gently, wanted to have a drink of Leng Cha, blew out the lamp and went to sleep. I reached the table along the seam of the bed, and I couldn't help looking at Miss Sun. I saw that sleep had washed her face clean and moist, and a pile of hair somehow covered her face, which added a laissez-faire charm to her face. The hair tip on the tip of the nose followed the snorting, which made her face itch. I wish I could reach out and sweep it for her. Her eyelashes seemed to move slightly in the light, and Hung-chien jumped up, thinking that maybe her eyes were wrong, or it seemed that she was suddenly short of breath. When she looked again, her sleeping face seemed to be reddening. Hurriedly blew out the lamp and slipped back to the bamboo couch, fearing for a long time.\r\nEarly tomorrow morning, Mr.Li saw yesterday's newspaper on the counter of the accounting office. The first news was that Changsha had burned to the ground, and his voice was lost in fear. It took him a minute to get it back and speak. Everyone was so anxious that they didn't have time to feel hungry that they saved a breakfast. Hung-chien has no idea at all, but it seems that this is not his own business. There is always a way to follow others. Li Mei-ting sighed, \"Bad luck! It's really bad luck to go out this time! Several places in Shanghai left me, and those who invited me invited me. I lost my head, but I suffered a lot because of Gao Songnian's kindness, and I had to give up halfway and go back! Who is this account to calculate? \" Hsin-mei said, \"There is no money to go back. I mean, I'll see what happens when I get the remittance from the school in Ji' an. Now I don't have to plan too early. \" Let's take a breath and relax. Gu erqian suddenly said wisely, \"if the school money is not remitted, it will be terrible.\" The four of them said impatiently that he was worrying too much, but they all evoked a response to his words in their consciousness. The reason given to each other was not to refute Gu Erqian, but to comfort themselves. Gu erqian tried to take back that sentence, as if the snake's tail was about to retract into the hole, and said, \"I know it's impossible, too. I just said it.\" Hung-chien said, \"I think this problem is easy to solve. Let's go alone first Ji' an has money, so he telegraphed everyone to go; Ji' an has no money, and it saves five people from rushing to the air, which wastes a lot of car money. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Look! Let's divide the work, wait for the luggage, and the one who gets the money will get the money. Let's be flexible and don't wait together. This money was remitted to me. I brought my luggage to Ji 'an first, and Hung-chien accompanied me, with many helpers. \"\r\nMiss Sun said gently and firmly, \"I'm going with Mr.Zhao, too, and my luggage is here.\"\r\nLi Meiting sharply gave Hsin-mei an X-ray perspective and said, \"OK, it's just me and Mr.Gu. But all our money has been confiscated. How much will you give us? \"\r\nGu erqian smiled apologetically at Li Meiting. \"All my luggage has arrived. I want to go with them. There is no point in staying here.\"\r\nLi Mei-ting blushed and said, \"You all went and left me alone. Good! I don't care. What' in the same boat'!",
        "30303187-40c3-4a71-b5bb-8924a8bfca36": "Let's be flexible and don't wait together. This money was remitted to me.

At the last moment, isn't everyone planning for themselves? To tell you the truth, when you get the money in Ji 'an, why don't you just give me a penny? Li Meiting won't beat me. It's easy to sell the medicine in my box for thousands of dollars in the mainland. You see, I also got to Shanghai for begging. \"\r\nHsin-mei said in surprise, \"Hey! Mr.Li, how did you misunderstand this point! \"\r\nGu erqian said soothingly, \"Mr.Mei Ting, I will never go first and wait for your luggage.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"What should we do? I'll go alone, okay? Mr.Li, you never suspect that I will swallow up public funds-do you want me to leave my luggage as a pledge! \" Say that finish to smile, reduce the seriousness of the meaning, but this smile is stiff and stubborn like a dry paste.\r\nLi Mei-ting waved his hand again and again and said, \"Joke! Joke! I'm definitely not speculating about people with the heart of a villain-\"Hung-chien said to himself,\" Say no! \" I think Mr.Fang's proposal is unrealistic. Mr.Fang, I'm sorry, I'm always straightforward. For example, Mr.Zhao, did you go to Ji' an to get the money alone, or did you move forward? What about turning back? You can't make decisions by yourself, but you have to ask for information on the spot and make a decision together-\"Hung-chien replied,\" So the four of us will go first. Obey the majority decision, aren't we the majority? \" Li Meiting couldn't speak, so Zhao Gu and the other two quickly persuaded her, saying, \"A friend in need should act in unison.\"\r\nAfter lunch, Hung-chien went back to his room, complaining that Hsin-mei was too soft and gave way to Li Mei-ting everywhere. \"You are really unhappy with your condescending attitude! Being a leader sometimes has to be tricky. \" Miss Sun said with a smile, \"At that time, I saw Mr.Fang and Mr.Li open their eyes. I looked at you and you looked at me. It was so funny! Like swallowing each other. \" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Shit! The gaffes are all in your eyes. I don't want to swallow him, Li Meiting, something that hurts my stomach-and am I angry? It seems that I didn't. \" Miss Sun said, \"Mr.Li is the hot air in your mouth and you are the cold air in your nose.\" Hsin-mei rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue at Hung-chien behind Miss Sun's back.\r\nOn the way to Ji 'an, they all hate that the car is stupid and slow, which drags down their eagerness to be free. At the same time, they are afraid that it will come to Ji 'an with nothing. They are willing to go on, go on, always start, never arrive, and keep a chance for hope. After staying in a hotel, I only had a dozen dollars left, and smiled and said, \"Never mind, I will be rich soon.\" Inquire about the hotel cashier, knowing that the bank is afraid of air strikes and will not open until after four o'clock in the afternoon, when it is working. Five people went to the bank and paid attention to whether there was a good restaurant all the way, because they hadn't had a good meal for a long time.

The clerk in the bank said that the money had been coming for several days and gave them a form to fill out. Hsin-mei asked the clerk for a writing brush to fill in, and Li Gu held him around, fearing that he could not write. This pen is bald and needs to be dipped in hair tonic, not ink. When Hsin-mei writes a pile of ink, Li Gu looks at it with disapproval. The clerk said, \"This is not easy to write. You can take it back and fill it out. Anyway, you'll have to find a pawnshop to stamp it-but I tell you, hotels can't be pawnshops. \" This frightened the five people, and told the clerk a lot of good things, saying that it was impossible to find a shop in a strange place, so could you bend the rules? The clerk expressed sympathy and regret, but business was business, so he had to follow the regulations and advised them to look for it first. When everyone left the bank, they cursed the articles of association for being unreasonable. After that, they comforted each other and said, \"Anyway, the money is coming.\" Tomorrow morning, Hsin-mei and Li Mei-ting ate some tired peanuts, drank half a pot of cold tea, and went out to find a local education institution. At two o'clock in the afternoon, they came back, dejected and exhausted, saying that all primary and secondary schools had been evacuated to the countryside, and no one had been found. \"Let's talk about it after dinner, you are also hungry.\" After eating a few mouthfuls of rice, the five people were refreshed. Suddenly, they remembered that the bank clerk was very polite. It seemed that he could not find a shop guarantee, so he might give the money. Let's discuss it with him in the evening. By five o'clock, Miss Sun stayed at the hotel and the four of them went to the bank again. Yesterday, the clerk had forgotten who they were. After asking, he still had to shop for insurance and teach them to go to the Education Bureau to find a way. He heard that the Education Bureau had not moved out. When everyone went back to the hotel, they saved money and went to bed without eating.\r\nHung-chien was so hungry that he couldn't sleep well, and his body was like a briefcase without papers, almost touching his back, that he realized that what the French called \"a day without bread\" was not friendly enough. It is not as long and difficult to look like a day without bread or a night with insomnia as a night without bread. Before the East was clear, Hsin-mei woke up, smacking his lips and licking his tongue. \"I'm so angry. I didn't have anything to eat in my dream, let alone wake up.\" He dreamed of having lunch at the Metropolitan Hotel, ordered hamburgers, steaks and lemon desserts, and woke up hungry when he couldn't wait. Hung-chien said, \"Please stop talking. You're making me even hungrier. You stingy guy, did I eat in your dream? \" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"I didn't have time to inform you. I didn't eat it anyway! Now that I've cooked Li Mei-ting for you to eat, you won't be too tired. \" Hung-chien said, \"Li Mei-ting doesn't have any meat. I think you are white and fat. You're so baked that you're soaked in sweet noodle sauce and salt and pepper.\" Hsin-mei moaned with a smile. \"You can't laugh when you're hungry, but it hurts more when you laugh. Boy! The hunger bit out of it like a tooth. Oh, dear-\"Hung-chien said,\" The more I lay down, the more miserable I became. I got up.",
        "048719cf-61f4-48eb-a849-febdb391ee92": "Hung-chien said, \"Please stop talking. You're making me even hungrier.

The hunger bit out of it like a tooth. Oh, dear-\"Hung-chien said,\" The more I lay down, the more miserable I became. I got up. Take a walk in the street and exercise, you can forget about hunger. The street is quiet in the morning, so go out for some fresh air. \" Hsin-mei said, \"No way! Fresh air is appetizing and invigorating the spleen. You really ask for it. I have to go to the education bureau to save my strength. I advise you-\"Laughing and screaming with pain-\"Don't go to the toilet, hold on, and leave something for your stomach. \" Before Hung-chien went out, Hsin-mei asked him for a large glass of water to fill his stomach. He lay on his back in bed, motionless, and when he turned to his side, there was a choppy sound in his body. Hung-chien took some surplus money from the public account, and was going to buy peanuts with shells instead of breakfast. Hsin-mei warned him not to steal it by playing with his hand. The market in the street, like a human face in the quilt, has not been exposed, and the grocery store selling peanuts is closed. Hung-chien walked a few steps ahead and smelled the smell of baked sweet potatoes. His nose was thirsty and he sucked like drinking water. Hunger immediately tightened his stomach. Baked sweet potato was originally like an adulterous man and woman in China proverb, \"It is better to steal than not to steal,\" and the fragrance is better than the taste; When you smell it, you think you have to eat it. It's really delicious, but it's not like you. Hung-chien saw a stall baking sweet potatoes, and thought it was much better than peanuts, so he would buy it for breakfast. Suddenly I noticed that someone was doing business in this stall, dressed like Li Meiting; Take a closer look, it's not who he is. He bought sweet potatoes and is eating them with his face to the wall. Hung-chien was embarrassed to bump into him, so he quickly hid in the alley. After he went, Hung-chien bought some back. When he entered the hotel, he was afraid that he would fall into the snobbery of the shopkeeper or the waiter, and they saw through the cold embarrassment, urged him to settle accounts and hurried to move. When Hsin-mei saw that it was baked sweet potato, he praised Hung-chien's purchasing skills. When Hung-chien told Hsin-mei about the talented person, Hsin-mei said, \"I know he didn't hand over all the money. He stole food in a panic. Don't have an infarction. If the baked sweet potato is eaten quickly, it will stalk the throat, and it will be hot. It's really a loss to him! \" When Miss Sun, Mr Li and Mr Gu came, they all said, \"Hey! How to find this thing? Wonderful! \"\r\nMr.Gu followed the Education Bureau and said that adding someone would be more powerful. Hung-chien is going, too. Hsin-mei thinks he hasn't combed his hair and shaved his beard for more than ten days. His face looks like a hedgehog and his hair looks like a hen hatching eggs in it. He is not allowed to go. Near noon, Miss Sun said, \"They haven't come back yet. I wonder if there is any hope?\" Hung-chien said, \"If you don't come back at this time, I think maybe things are settled. If they simply refuse, they will come back early and the Education Bureau is not far away. \" Hsin-mei went to the hotel, drank half a pot of water, caught his breath, and cursed the director of education for being a confused chicken. Li Gu also said, \"How outrageous.\"",
        "28fef013-0024-407a-b1a6-55e0045c3f6e": "Wonderful! \"\r\nMr.Gu followed the Education Bureau and said that adding someone would be more powerful. Hung-chien is going, too.

Li Gu also said, \"How outrageous.\" It turned out that the director arrived at the bureau very late, and he finally came. When he was interviewed, his tone was tighter than that of a tin can filled with food. Not only did he refuse to vouch for them, but he also suspected that they were liars. Two fingers flicked at Li Meiting's film as if they were picking up garbage, and his eyes glanced at the words on the film and said, \"I am an old Shanghai, and I know everything on the beach. This kind of journalism school always hangs empty signs-don't get me wrong.\" National San Lv University? This name is very vivid! I've never heard of it. Newly established? Then I should know! \" Poor them, they dare not eat more food this day. The food they eat can't make them not hungry, but only nourish and cultivate hunger, so that hunger can last in their bodies, and they won't starve to death. Hsin-mei said, \"If we go on like this, when we get the money, we'll all be dead, so we'll have to buy coffins to bury.\" Mr.Gu's eyes suddenly lit up and said, \"Did you two see that' Women's Association' on the way? I saw it. I think a woman is soft-hearted. Asking Miss Sun to go there may have some connections-this is of course the last resort. \" Miss Sun said without a word, \"I'll go now.\" Hsin-mei looked embarrassed at Miss Sun and said, \"How can this be done? Your father entrusted you to me. I can't do well. How can I drag you down? \" Miss Sun said, \"I've taken care of Mr.Zhao all the way-\"Hsin-mei didn't want to hear her thank herself, so she quickly said, \"OK, give it a try. I hope you're luckier than us.\" Miss sun didn't meet anyone at the women's association, which means she will go again early. Applying his knowledge of psychology, Hung-chien said, \"It's no use meeting people again. Women are the most suspicious and the least angry. If you ask a woman to beg a woman, you will hit a nail. \" Hsin-mei was worried that he would not be able to pay the bill tomorrow because the hotel's regulations stipulated that the account would be settled in three days. Mr.Li said generously, \"If there is nothing to do tomorrow and the hotel forces money, I will just sell the medicine.\" Miss Sun will come back with a lesbian in gray cloth and military uniform less than an hour tomorrow. After chatting in her room for a while, Miss Sun came out and invited Hsin-mei and others in. The lesbian is looking at Miss Sun's diploma-there is a beautiful photo of Miss Sun wearing a square hat on it. Miss sun introduced them one by one, and Mr.Li sent the film. She was awed, saying that she had a friend who worked in the Highway Bureau and might help. She would reply later. Everyone was grateful, but they were afraid to leave her for dinner. When they saw her off, Miss Sun shook hands with her, which was especially affectionate. During the lunch, Miss Sun complimented her fellow travelers with faces like the rising sun in the east.\r\nUntil five o'clock in the afternoon, the lesbian disappeared, and everyone was hungry and anxious. They asked Miss Sun several times, but they couldn't find a reason. Hung-chien felt that there was an omen in the air that the money would not be available, so he dragged it down without doing anything, and he couldn't make it strong, as if he were going to hit the rotating spring door.",

At eight o'clock in the evening, everyone waited with moldy hearts and despair, so they simply stopped worrying and got ready for bed. The lesbian and her boyfriend are just like the poet's quip \"I can't find them every day, and sometimes I come by myself\". Suddenly, the five of them are as happy as meeting a long-lost lover and as affectionate as a dog to welcome their master home. The man sat down with a big thorn, and every question was answered diligently, which led him to stop his hand and say, \"One person has enough to talk.\" He asked Miss Sun for a diploma, and carefully identified the photo with Miss Sun herself. Miss Sun slightly suspected that he was admiring himself instead of taking photos, and she was embarrassed. He questioned Chao Hsin-mei again and blamed them for not bringing their documents with them. His girlfriend said something nice to him, and he was gentle, saying that he was not suspicious and would like to make friends, but I don't know if it is effective to spread insurance in the name of the highway bureau. Tell them to ask the bank first and inform him to stamp it. So they stayed one more day and went to the bank once more. That night, everyone was asleep and still hungry, as if hungry declared independence, concretized and separated from the body.\r\nTwo days later, they received the money; On the way between the hotel and the bank, their shoes are so familiar that they can go back and forth without feet. The bank also handed them a new telegram from Gao Songnian, asking them to rest assured that the war in Changsha had no effect. That evening, in the name of reward and celebration, they invited lesbianzhi and her friends to a restaurant for a big meal. After three glasses of wine, Mr.Gu opened his mouth with laughter. daughter laugh's gold teeth were brilliant, and his wine-baked face shone like a sea lamp around the table. He said, \"When we left Shanghai, Mr.Li once counted our lives, saying that he had the support of distinguished people, and he turned his luck all the way. Sure enough, he met you two by chance and became our sponsor. There is no limit to how rich and expensive you will be in the future-Mr.Zhao and Mr.Li, let's propose a toast to them, Miss Sun, you, you and you have a drink. \" Miss Sun thought that she was referring to herself as a \"noble person\". She bowed her head early, and a burst of red news leaked on her face. Later, when she heard this, it was completely irrelevant. This red image was like the breath on the glass in warm weather, and it dispersed before it became dizzy. Although the lesbian and her friends are citizens of democratic countries and know that people are more important, they are flattered by this feudal thought and their faces are as happy as red flowers in full bloom. Hsin-mei said mischievously, \"When it comes to distinguished people, Miss Sun is also a distinguished person. Without her,\" Li Mei-ting offered a toast to Miss Sun before he could finish. Hung-chien said, \"I'm most ashamed. I didn't do anything this time. I'm really useless.\" Li Mei-ting said, \"Yes! Xiao Fang is a real noble. He sits still in the hotel and we run errands for him. Hsin-mei, although we got nothing, we ran hard enough, huh? \" Before going to bed that night, Hsin-mei said, \"You can sleep comfortably today. Hung-chien, look at that lesbian. She's really ugly. She's even more scared to death after drinking. Even a man loves her. \"",

For ugly people, it is cruel to look closely-unless he is a bad person, you should punish him. \"\r\nTomorrow morning, they arrived at Jiehualong, which is the border between Jiangxi and Hunan. The Jiangxi bus won't go past, so they should take the Hunan bus that leaves at noon instead. They came by bus all the way, and they never got to the station so fast. Regardless of how little they walked, they felt that they had made a net profit for a long time, so they said they would take a night off and not catch the bus today. This is a desolate and desolate place. There are seven or eight small shops on the left and right sides of the station, with the back of the road. In the store where they stay, the kitchen is located at the door. The front room is the dining hall for passers-by during the day and the bridal chamber for the owner and his wife at night. The back room is divided into two rooms that are dark, leaking, warm in summer and cool in winter, and timely in the weather. There is a strong smell of urine around the store, as if the store is a vegetable, and guests have the obligation to irrigate with fertilizer. The shopkeeper was cooking in the street, which only caused Hsin-mei and others to sneeze in the room. Hung-chien thought he had caught a cold. Mr.Li said, \"Who cares about me at home!\" It was only later that I realized that it was smoked for the peppers in the dish. After dinner, all four men took a nap. Miss Sun shared a room with Hsin-mei and Hung-chien, saying that she was not sleepy. She sat in the bamboo couch outside reading and fell asleep. She woke up with a headache and was cold, so she couldn't eat anything at dinner. It's late autumn weather, the mountains are deep and the days are short, and a ray of moon is exposed in the clouds, just like a crowded nearsighted eye. After a while, the moon was so smooth that it couldn't stick to anything, so light that it couldn't hold anything down. It emerged from under the fluffy clouds without care, and there was still one side that was not full, like a slap in the face. Miss Sun felt sick in her stomach and suggested walking on the moon. Everyone walked along the road, the grass was everywhere, there were no trees, and there were no decent black shadows. The night decorations were all stripped by the moon, leaving no dignity.\r\nThat night, the cold in the mountains made the passengers' sleep shrink, which was not enough to wrap the whole body and mind. The five of them only slept until dawn. As usual, Hsin-mei and Hung-chien sneaked out early in the morning to let Miss Sun get dressed in her room. They went back to the room to get a towel and toothbrush, and saw that Miss Sun had not got up yet, and was covered with her head and groaned. They asked her what was wrong with her body, and she said that she was too dizzy to turn to her side and dare not open her eyes. Hsin-mei put his hand on her forehead and said, \"The heat seems to be gone. I'm afraid I'm tired and caught some cold. Don't worry about having a good rest for a day, and the three of us will leave tomorrow. \" Miss Sun said it was unnecessary, raised her head on airs, fell down again, exhaled for a long time and asked them to put a spittoon in front of her bed.",

Hung-chien asked about the main spittoon in the shop, and the owner said that such a big place was not enough to spit? What's the use of a spittoon? Half a day to find out a broken wooden basin for washing feet. Miss sun vomited straight into the basin and lay down after vomiting. Hung-chien went out to ask for boiled water. Hsin-mei said that the sun was shining outside, and the pillow in the bamboo lounge chair was high, so it was more comfortable to sleep. She was taught to try on clothes and was put on the lounge chair for her first. Miss Sun refused to let them help her, lowered her head and closed her eyes, touched the wall and went to the recliner and collapsed. Hung-chien filled Hsin-mei's rubber hot water bottle, warmed her stomach and asked her if she wanted to drink water. She took a sip and spat it out. They were anxious. They thought that there might be Rendan in the medicine Li Meiting brought, so they asked him for a pack through the door. Li Meiting is lazy in bed because the bus doesn't leave until noon. His medicine was taken to the school and sold at a good price. He kept it intact and prepared to sell it to schools and hospitals in the hinterland at ten times the original price. A pack of Rendan was opened but only a few pills were eaten, but once the cover was removed, the rest could not be sold, and I was embarrassed to settle accounts with Miss Sun. Although Rendan was of little value, he thought that Miss Sun's attitude towards herself along the way was not enough for Rendan's friendship. Instead of giving her medicine, you show your meanness. When he was in Ji 'an, he didn't have enough meals, and he was worried that he would suffer from malnutrition. He secretly opened a bottle of Japanese brand cod liver oil pills, and after a meal every day, he took three pills as a tonic. Cod liver oil pills are certainly more expensive than Rendan, but the opened medicine bottles, like married women, have reduced the market price. When Mr.Li put on his clothes and went out to ask, he knew that his stomach was cold, and he would be fine if he lay down. He thought it was okay to eat cod liver oil pills, so he said, \"You should have breakfast first, and I'll serve Miss Sun to take medicine.\" Hsin-mei and Hung-chien avoided suspicion and didn't want Li Mei-ting to say that they had taken his credit and really had breakfast. Li Meiting went back to her room to take a pill and ask for a cup of boiled water. Miss Sun opened her eyes lazily and swallowed at his mercy. After eating breakfast, Hung-chien went to see Miss Sun, only smelling fishy smell. He thought that she had vomited again. Why did she have such a strange smell? He was just about to ask her, but suddenly he saw that her cheeks were all wet, and some tears flowed through her ears from the closed eyes and dripped on the pillow. Hung-chien was at a loss in panic, as if he had accidentally broken a secret he shouldn't have read, and quickly told Hsin-mei secretly. Hsin-mei also thought that this kind of crying was not allowed to be known to strangers, and he dared not ask her questions. They refer to all the knowledge about women in their lives to explain why she is crying. As a result, great minds think alike, saying that most of her crying is due to psychological pain; Girls leave home thousands of miles away, get sick halfway, have no friends, and naturally cry. Because she cried, the two men dared not make any noise, especially pitying her.",

Because she cried, the two men dared not make any noise, especially pitying her. They all said that they should treat her better and go to see her gently. She seems to be asleep, with tears and dust on her face, forming several black marks; Fortunately, young women's tears are not raindrops in autumn and winter, so they don't destroy their faces and decay. They are just like the dream rain in Qingming Festival, which swells the ground and adds some mud.\r\nDuring the four or five days from Jiehualong to Shaoyang, their journey was smooth like satin. They hung on the newly discovered truth and said, \"Money is indispensable.\" Shaoyang is a mountain road to school, so you have to change to a sedan chair. Tired of taking the bus, they took a sedan chair and liked it very much. After sitting for a while, I realized that it was worse than the car. My toes hurt from cold first, so I would rather get out of the sedan chair and walk for a while before sitting. The rugged and endless mountains and fields along the way seem that time has forgotten this road. After walking for more than 70 miles, time seems to have taken them back. The mountain fog gradually rises, and the shade turns to faint, and the faint condensation turns to black, which is the small village where they stayed tonight. When they entered the fire shop, the bearers and porters made a fire, and everyone gathered around to keep warm and cook. There is no light in the fire shop at night, so a long piece of firewood is burned at one end and inserted in the mud pile. The slim flame swings and expands, and the shadows of things in the room follow. Hsin-mei and others slept in the same room, without a bed, just five stacks of hay. They would rather sleep on straw than those beds in hotels, or like a concave-convex map, or like the chest of a lung patient. Hung-chien was so tired that he was sleepy, and his heart was finally restless. He slept all around, but he couldn't close it, as if two curtains were about to be stitched together. Suddenly, the zipper got stuck and leaked into the outside world. I finally fell asleep, and a small voice in the depths of my dream cried, \"Don't hold down my red cotton-padded jacket! Don't hold down my red cotton-padded jacket! \" Hung-chien instinctively rolled away, woke up like a leap of consciousness, and sighed at the side of his head, which was as slight as a suppressed emotion secretly breathing. His hair stood on end with fear, and he couldn't see anything in the dark. He wanted to strike a match, but he was afraid that he had actually seen something. Hsin-mei was snoring and a dog was barking in the distance. He must be calm, laughing at himself, and he is nervous to sleep. It seems that there is some power to refuse him to sleep, to prop up his body and mind, to prop up, and not to let him settle down. When he feels awake between sleeping and waking, a person is relaxed and suspended, and when he falls asleep, he is heavy. Struggling, he listened to Miss Sun's shortness of breath, which made him want to cry. His attention was focused, and his sleep dissipated again, with a clear sigh in his ear, as if he had exhaled after work. On the side of his head, Hung-chien avoided the sighing mouth, and his throat was choked with terror. He couldn't pronounce the word \"who is it?\" I was afraid that the mouth would close its ear and tell himself who he was, so that he was covered with his head and his heart beat like a box in his chest.",

After hearing Hsin-mei grind his teeth in his sleep, the sound relieved his terror and made him feel that he was back in the human world, sticking his head out, something ran past his head and a mouse screamed. He struck a match, and the neurotic flame jumped out, but he had caught a glimpse of the twelve o'clock on the watch. Miss Sun was awakened by the fire and turned over. Hung-chien asked her if she had a nightmare. Miss Sun told him that in her dream, it was like a pair of children's hands pushed her away and she was not allowed to sleep. Hung-chien also expressed his impression and advised her not to be afraid.\r\nBefore five o'clock in the morning, the bearers washed rice and cooked. Hung-chien and Miss Sun didn't sleep at midnight, so they got up and went outside to get some fresh air. Only then did I find that the back of this house is full of graves. It seems that this house was built by leveling the graves. Not far behind the fire shop, a door-breaking frame stood, and the house burned down, leaving only this entrance and exit, and two doors were removed. Hung-chien pointed to the earthen steamed buns and asked, \"Miss Sun, do you believe in ghosts?\" Since the nightmare, Miss Sun has known Hung-chien much better and said with a smile, \"That's hard to answer. Sometimes, I believe in ghosts; Sometimes, I never believe in ghosts. Last night, for example, I thought ghosts were terrible. But at this time, although there are graves all around, I think ghosts definitely don't have this thing. \" Hung-chien said, \"That's a very fresh idea. The existence of ghosts is indeed timely, like flowers in spring, but not in summer. \" Miss Sun said, \"You said that the voice you heard was like a child's, and the hands in my dream were like a child's. This is too strange.\" Hung-chien said, \"Maybe the place where we slept was originally a child's grave. You see, these graves are very small and don't look like adults'.\" Miss Sun asked innocently, \"Why don't ghosts grow up? Children have been dead for decades or children? \" Hung-chien said, \"This is the place where where will you go is better than a hundred-year reunion. It can keep people from getting old. Not only will ghosts never grow up, but our long-lost friends are still elegant demeanour in our minds, even though we are old-hey, Hsin-mei. \" Hsin-mei laughed and said, \"What did you two come to this haunted house early in the morning to talk about?\" When they told him what happened last night, he sneered, \"You two are really connected with each other. It's amazing! I don't feel anything at all; Of course, I am a clown, and ghosts don't bother to visit-the sedan chair bearer said that I can go to school this afternoon. \"\r\nFang Hung-chien thought in his sedan chair that he had arrived at school today, and I don't know what it was like. Anyway, I don't expect anything. It's a good symbol to break the door behind the fire shop. It's like an entrance, and there is a deep palace building hidden behind it, which attracts people to go in. It turns out that there is nothing, an entrance that can't be entered and a place to go. \"Give up all hope, you people who come in!\" Having said that, the uncontrollable curiosity and hope, like boiling water on the stove, vigorously overturned the lid of the pot. I only think that the sedan chair is uncomfortable, so I would rather get out of the sedan chair and go by myself.",

Encouraged by this mentality, Hsin-mei got restless in the sedan chair, got out of it and walked, saying, \"Hung-chien, this walk has really added a lot of experience. Finally, I have accomplished my merits and learned the Buddhist scriptures. At least I can stay away from Li Meiting and Gu Erqian in the future. Needless to say, Li Mei-ting's ugly smile on Gu Erqian's shoulders is really unbearable. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I found that flattery is like love, and no third party is allowed to look on coldly. When we compliment people in the future, we must be careful that there are no other people around. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"A trip like ours is the best test of a person's character. Travel is the most tiring, troublesome and revealing time. Only people who don't hate each other after a long journey can make friends-wait a minute, listen to me-the honeymoon trip after marriage is reversed, and they should travel together for a month. After a month of travel, the two sides have not seen through each other, hated each other, quarreled and turned against each other, but they still have to maintain their original engagement. This kind of couple promises not to divorce. \"\r\n\"Why don't you tell this to Cao Yuanlang and his wife?\"\r\n\"I said this sentence for you, sonny[5]. Miss Sun's trip didn't annoy you, did it? \" As Hsin-mei said this, he looked back at Miss Sun's sedan chair, turned around and laughed.\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous. Let me ask you, how do you feel about me after this trip? Do you think I hate it? \"\r\n\"You don't hate it, but it's useless.\"\r\nHung-chien didn't expect Hsin-mei to answer so simply, so he had to smile bitterly. He walked a few steps silently, waved to Hsin-mei and said, \"I went in a sedan chair.\" On the sedan chair, unhappy, I don't know why speaking frankly is a virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wife in the office.\r\n[2] The hero.\r\n[3] Professor Li Meiting.

The position of the word \"old\" is very difficult. It can describe both science and scientists. Unfortunately, scientists are very different from science. Scientists are like wine, and the older they get, the more valuable they are, while science is like women, which is worthless when they get old. In the future, when Chinese grammar is fully developed, one day \"old scientists\" and \"home of old scientists\" can be clearly separated, or \"home of science\" and \"old scientists\". It's still very early, so we might as well call it a general term. President Gao's fat and strong face is like unfermented yellow flour steamed bread, and \"greedy time\" can't bite him, and there are no teeth marks or wrinkles. If a female student who violates the school rules is very beautiful, President Gao may be lenient if she pleads with herself to apologize, not out of the spirit of education. This proves that the scientist is not old. He studied entomology in foreign countries twenty years ago. I think all the insects twenty years ago have evolved into university teachers and students, so I asked him to set an example for the toast. He is still a promising person among the university presidents. University presidents are divided into two categories: liberal arts background and science background. People from liberal arts backgrounds can't easily do this job, and they are not proud of it.",

He is still a promising person among the university presidents. University presidents are divided into two categories: liberal arts background and science background. People from liberal arts backgrounds can't easily do this job, and they are not proud of it. They must have run into a wall in politics, learned from being an official but not excellent, and used the grace of poetry and the sound of string recitation to recuperate their body and mind. People with science backgrounds are completely different. China is the country that advocates science the most in the world, and no other country is willing to do this for scientists. With the progress of foreign science, China scientists have been promoted. In foreign countries, the study of human feelings is always different from the study of physics; In China, as long as you know about water and electricity, civil engineering, machinery, animals and plants, etc., you can be a political person-this is the greatest victory of \"natural uniformity\". Being a principal is just the beginning of a political career. In the past, the way of university was to rule the country and level the world, but now it is the way of university and it is an open road. For the first category, the university is a rocking chair for rest; For the second category, it is a cradle of cultivation-as long as he is careful not to fall asleep.\r\nGao Songnian worked hard and was a pro-provost. He was so smart that he slept with his eyes open and glasses on, and his dreams were unambiguous. The cradle is also well chosen, in the garden of a local rich man in Pingcheng County, facing the stream and facing the mountain. This town is by no means a strategic battleground, and the only thing that the Japanese are generous and generous-bombs-will not be wasted in this place. Therefore, less than half a mile away from the school, the town is thriving day by day, with photo shops, restaurants, bathrooms, local theaters, police stations and primary and secondary schools. This spring, Gao Songnian was ordered to prepare for the school, and several old friends from Chongqing gave him a farewell dinner. At the meeting, it was said that there are many universities in China but few professors, and the newly established schools that have not yet become famous are remote, and they are afraid that they will not be able to invite famous professors. Gao Songnian smiled and said, \"My opinion is different from yours. A famous professor is certainly very good, but because of his fame, the school is stained with his light, and he does not rely on his position in the school. He has a shelf and a temper, and he will not serve the school wholeheartedly, let alone obey the command of the authorities absolutely. In case he is at odds, it is not easy for you to find a substitute, and students will have to borrow questions to trouble. I think schools should not only train students, but also train professors. Find a group of people who have no fame. They need the credit of the school. They depend on the school for their status, and the school doesn't have to have them. Such talents can really integrate with the school and are willing to contribute to the public. The school is also an institution, and the institution certainly needs scientific management. In a sound institution, there are no special people, only those who are governed by the law. Therefore, it is not difficult to find a professor. \" Everyone listened and fell in love. Kao Sung-nien didn't have this opinion in advance, so he just made irresponsible remarks for a while. After such a compliment from his friends, he gradually believed that this was really a wise saying, and he was also fascinated by himself. Since then, he has always made this remark, adding a hat: \"I study biology, and the school is also an organism. Teachers should be to the school what cells are to the organism-\"This wise saying has become a scientific law.",

They arrived at school at two o'clock that afternoon; Kao Sung-nien hurried to the teachers' dormitory to socialize. When he returned to the office, his worries in January could no longer be put aside. Since the crisis in Changsha, nine out of ten professors who have been hired have telegraphed for an excuse to cancel their contracts, and they have been scattered and unable to start classes. Fortunately, only 158 students have been affected by the war. Today, there are four professors, who are in great shock, so it is more decent to report to the Ministry. Just how to explain it to Li Meiting and Fang Hung-chien? Wang Chuhou, the minister of the Ministry, introduced Wang Chuhou to be the head of the China Literature Department, and he had written to appoint Li Meiting himself-but Wang Chuhou was Wang Chuhou's uncle, and his qualifications were better than Li Meiting's. At that time, the telegrams to the professors who resigned one after another were scared, and they were afraid that these people in Shanghai would return their tickets halfway, so they had to perfunctory Wang Chuchang first. Wang Chuhou is not easy to send away. Li Meiting is an old friend. Old friends always talk openly, and they are afraid that his temper is difficult to deal with. This young man named Fang is easy to deal with. He is Zhao Xinmei's boss. Hsin-mei refused to come at first and introduced him, saying that he was a doctor studying in Germany. What a fool! His own education, without a degree, is just a \"tourist student\" wandering around the world, and he doesn't study politics. It's too wrong to hire him as a professor! At most, associate professors should be promoted step by step, and young people should not climb too high. This can be told by Hsin-mei. It's Li Mei-ting who's in trouble-in any case, he's come through a lot of trouble and will never leave as soon as he turns his face; It's hard to come, but it's not so easy to go. Just give him some benefits. He jumped from a private school to a state school, didn't he just promote him himself? A man must have a conscience. These things are tomorrow anyway, don't think about it, today-there is a police chief's dinner tonight. As usual, this dinner was a dinner party, and there were only a few things in the small towns. Gao Songnian was tired of eating it, but at this time it was past four o'clock and he was a little hungry, so the thought of dinner made his mouth moist.\r\nWhen people on the same road arrive at their destination, they disperse, like water in a wave hitting the shore and splashing around. However, Hung-chien and the four men went to the town to have their hair cut and take a bath together that day. When I came back to school, I saw a notice on the bulletin board with pink paper, saying that students from China Literature Department would hold a tea party in the friendship room at 7: 30 tonight to welcome Mr.Li Meiting. Mei Ting said with joy, \"Damn, damn! I'm so tired that I want to go to bed early today! These children are too enthusiastic to be reasonable. Mr.Zhao, their news is really clever! \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"How outrageous! Why didn't the political department students welcome me at the meeting? \"\r\nMei Ting said, \"What are you busy with?",

Will you go to today's welcome party for me? I'd rather sleep. \"\r\nGu Erqian nodded and sighed: \"People who read China, after all, are polite. I don't think the students in the collateral department will respect the teacher so much.\" After that, I looked at Li Meiting with a smile. At this time, God would regret not adding a wagging dog tail to people, thus reducing the effect of many expressions.\r\nHung-chien said, \"What departments are you in? I don't know which department you are a professor. The telegram sent to me by President Gao didn't make it clear. \"\r\nHsin-mei said quickly, \"That doesn't matter. You can teach philosophy and Chinese-\"\r\nMei Ting grinned grimly. \"You need my permission to teach Chinese, Mr.Fang. Please curry favor with me and discuss everything.\"\r\nAs she spoke, Miss Sun came and said that she lived in a girl's dormitory, shared a room with the girl's tutor Miss Fan, and complimented Li Meiting on the reception. Mei Ting said with a frivolous smile, \"Miss Sun, you should change your profession and stop working in the office of the foreign languages department. You should be my teaching assistant. Tonight, we will go to the meeting together.\" While the five of them were having dinner at the small restaurant at the school gate, Li Mei-ting didn't listen, but didn't know the taste. Everyone laughed at him for preparing to welcome the speech at the meeting. Mei-ting argued fiercely, \"Nonsense! What preparation is this! \"\r\nNear nine o'clock in the evening, Fang Hung-chien was talking in Zhao Xinmei's room and yawned. He was about to go back to his room to sleep when Li Meiting knocked at the door and came in. The two wanted to tease him, but seeing that his face was not straight, they asked, \"Why did the welcome party end so early?\" Without saying a word, Mei Ting sat down in a chair, breathing like a locomotive to be developed. They asked him what was wrong. He slapped the table and cursed Gao Songnian for being an asshole, saying that he would not lose if the lawsuit went to the Ministry of Education. Gao Songnian, as the principal, went out for dinner, but he didn't come back at this time, and he couldn't find the shadow. This kind of dereliction of duty should be damned. It turned out that today's welcome meeting was arranged by Wang Chuhou, who famously said in the art of war that \"the enemy will be attacked head-on, if he is still breathing\". The four lecturers and teaching assistants of China Literature Department who came to the school first became one with him, and the students were obedient. He knew that Kao Sung-nien had an appointment with Li Mei-ting, and that he had taken advantage of his weakness to steal. However, being the head of the department is just like getting married. This meeting is not a welcome, but a gift for the new aunt. As soon as Li Meiting followed the student representatives into the meeting, he felt the air was different. After hearing colleagues and students repeatedly calling \"Director Wang\", he was already suspicious and panicked. When Wang Chuhou met him, he held his hand warmly, rubbing it for a long time, as if grabbing his mistress's hand, and said with resentment, \"Mr.Li, you really made us wait for death. We are expecting you every day-Mr.Zhang, Mr.Xue, we didn't talk about him this morning-we talked about you this morning. Did you have a hard journey? Have a good rest for two days before class, not busy. I have arranged all your lessons.",

President Gao sent a telegram to Chengdu asking me to organize the Department of China Literature. I thought I was getting old and the road was not easy, so I really didn't want to come at first. President Gao, he is really good at grinding people! He invited his nephew-\"Mr.Zhang, Mr.Xue and Mr.Huang said in unison:\" Mr.Wang is the uncle of Wang Jichang. \" -\"please give up my nephew to persuade me to drive again and again, but I'm ungrateful. My wife is in poor health and wants to change the air. I'm so glad to know that you're here, and I think the department has done a good job-\"Li Meiting choked up a lecture in a director's tone, held back his breath, struck up a conversation, drank a cup of tea, only pushed a headache, and left early.\r\nHsin-mei and Hung-chien comforted Li Mei-ting for a while and advised him to go back to his room to sleep. They would like to talk to Gao Songnian tomorrow. Mei Ting said before he left, \"With my friendship with Lao Gao, he will still play tricks on me. He must have played tricks on you two, too. Watch, let's take concerted action, what are we afraid of him! \" After Mei Ting left, Hung-chien looked at Hsin-mei and said, \"This is beyond words!\" Hsin-mei frowned and said, \"I think there is a misunderstanding. I don't know anything about it. Maybe Li Meiting is unrequited at all, otherwise it's outrageous! However, it's also a joke that a person like Li Meiting really wants to be a director. His title-printing business cards can't be used now, haha. \" Hung-chien said, \"I'm unlucky this year anyway, and I'm going to run into difficulties everywhere. Maybe tomorrow Gao Songnian will deny me as a lame professor. \" Hsin-mei said impatiently, \"Here we go again! You seem to have a bad heart. I'm telling you, you can't believe everything Li Meiting says-besides, you are from my face and I have everything. \" Although Hung-chien was pessimistic with the greatest determination, he felt that this pessimism might as well be postponed for one day.\r\nTomorrow morning, Hsin-mei went to the principal's office first, and said that he would explain Hung-chien's affairs clearly, and told him to wait and see Gao Songnian after hearing the reply. Hung-chien waited for more than an hour, impatient, thinking that he was really nervous. Gao Songnian sent a telegram directly. Is the leader of such an institution too embarrassed to be accurate? Hsin-mei has already done his duty as an introducer, and now he is going to pay a formal visit to Gao Songnian himself, which is the simplest.\r\nGao Songnian looked at Fang Hung-chien with a pleasant face. He didn't believe that there would be such a good-natured or shrewd person in the world. He quickly asked, \"Have you met Mr.Zhao?\"\r\n\"Not yet. I should come to see the headmaster, which is the proper rule. \" Fang Hung-chien is confident that he can speak appropriately.\r\nKao Sung-nien thinks it's terrible! Shit!

        "8279ff9e-953a-4ccf-a81b-2d3b1c375166": "Hsin-mei has already done his duty as an introducer, and now he is going to pay a formal visit to Gao Songnian himself, which is the simplest.\r\nGao Songnian looked at Fang Hung-chien with a pleasant face.

Hsin-mei must be entangled in Li Mei-ting, and he can't help talking to this Fang: \"Mr.Fang, I want to talk to you-I've already told Mr.Zhao a lot.\" Hung-chien didn't listen to what he said, but the smile on his face didn't converge for a moment, and he lingered uncomfortably. Gao Songnian hated to pinch his finger off for him-\"Mr.Fang, have you received my letter?\" Most people lie, and their mouths can't cooperate with their eyes. Although their mouths are full of nonsense, their eyes are timid and dare not look at each other. When Gao Songnian was sophisticated and studied biology, he learned the wisdom handed down by westerners, that is, if your eyes can meet those of a lion or a tiger and glare at each other, the beast will hypnotize you and dare not pounce on you. Of course, wild animals may not be willing to make eyes at you before enjoying you, but Fang Hung-chien is not a wild animal, but he can only be regarded as a domestic animal at most.\r\nHe gave Kao Sung-nien a 300-watt look, feeling that it was his own fault that he didn't receive this letter. This time, it was too presumptuous. Sure enough, Kao Sung-nien wrote back his life, and at the same time, he felt a kind of unexpected satisfaction and said, \"No! I really didn't receive it! Is it important or not? When did Mr.Gao send it? \" It's like telling a lie and denying it when you receive a letter.\r\n\"hey! Why didn't you receive it? \" Kao Sung-nien jumped up straight, and his fake surprised expression was lifelike, which was much more natural than Fang Hung-chien's real alarm. He didn't play the drama, which was the misfortune of the drama but the great fortune of the actors-\"This letter is very important. Alas! The postal service during the Anti-Japanese War is damn right now. But your husband has come, very well, and these words can be interviewed. \"\r\nA little relieved, Hung-chien pandered, \"Letters from the mainland to Shanghai often go wrong. I'm afraid the war in Changsha will also have an impact, and a large number of letters will be lost. If Mr.Gao sends me a letter early-\"\r\nGao Songnian made a gesture of putting everything aside and generously forgave the letter that Fang Hung-chien didn't receive: \"Needless to mention the letter, I'm afraid that Mr.Fang will not give in after reading it. Now that you're here, you can't run away, hehe! Listen to me. Although your husband and I have never met, I was so glad to hear Hsin-mei talk about your knowledge and personality. I immediately sent a telegram asking your husband to help me. The telegram said, \"Kao Sung-nien had a meal to test whether Hung-chien is a good negotiator, because a good negotiator will never make a promise for himself at this time.\r\nHowever, Fang Hung-chien swallowed the bait like a fish, and as soon as he caught it, he quickly said, \"Mr.Gao telegraphed me to be a professor, but he didn't explain what department he was a professor in, so I want to ask.\"\r\n\"I would like to invite Mr.Wang to be a professor in the political department, because Mr.Wang was introduced by Hsin-mei and said that Mr.Wang was a doctor studying in Germany. But Mr.Wang didn't have a degree on his resume-\"Hung-chien blushed like a patient with 103 degrees of cold and fever-\"and he didn't study politics. Hsin-mei was all wrong. Mr.Wang's friendship with Hsin-mei was not very deep, was it? \" The cold and heat on Hung-chien's face rose once again to the Fahrenheit scale, and I didn't know how to answer it.",
        "1dd9e026-cf85-41c4-b4ae-8eec4217e206": "However, Fang Hung-chien swallowed the bait like a fish, and as soon as he caught it, he quickly said, \"Mr.Gao telegraphed me to be a professor, but he didn't explain what department he was a professor in, so I want to ask.\"\r\n\"I would like to invite Mr.Wang to be a professor in the political department, because Mr.Wang was introduced by Hsin-mei and said that Mr.Wang was a doctor studying in Germany.

Gao Songnian was even bolder when he saw it-\"Of course, I never care about the degree, I only talk about real talent and practical learning. However, the rules set by the Ministry are very rigid. According to Mr.' s education, he can only be a full-time lecturer at most, and the report of professor's treatment must be refuted. I believe Hsin-mei's recommendation can't be wrong, so I hire Mr.Hsin as an associate professor with a monthly salary of 280 yuan, which will be promoted next school year. Express mail to Mr.Wang is to explain this matter. I thought Mr.Wang received the letter. \"\r\nHung-chien had to declare for the second time that he didn't receive the letter, and at the same time he felt that he had been demoted to associate professor.\r\n\"I have just asked Hsin-mei to bring Mr.Wang's letter of appointment. What courses Mr.Wang teaches is now a problem. We don't have a philosophy department for the time being, but there are enough professors in the Chinese literature department. There is only a class of first-year students in the grammar school who study ethics together. Three hours seems to be too little. I'll think of something in the future. \"\r\nWhen Hung-chien left the principal's office, his soul seemed to have been rolled by steam, and he had no spirit. I only feel that I am an abandoned object taken in by Gao Songnian in a merciful way. I am full of shame and hate, but I have no object to vent. When he returned to his room, Hsin-mei came and said that Li Mei-ting had finally helped Gao Songnian solve the problem and wanted to talk about Hung-chien. Knowing that Hung-chien had talked to Kao Sung-nien, he said quickly, \"You haven't turned against him, have you? This is all my fault. I have the impression that you are a doctor. When I introduced you here, I only hoped that it would be successful soon-\"\"so that you can go to Miss Su. \" -\"needless to say, I put my salary,-good, good! I don't, I don't! \" Hsin-mei apologized apologetically, praised Hung-chien for his self-restraint, and said that he was speaking in the principal's office when Li Mei-ting came straight in and roared inappropriately. Hung-chien asked about Mei Ting. Hsin-mei sneered, \"Gao Songnian asked me to persuade him. He kept pestering him for a long time. He said that unless the school bought the western medicine he brought at his price-alas, I still have to give Gao Songnian an answer. I was worried about you, so I came back to see you first. \" Hung-chien was angry at first, but when he learned that Kao Sung-nien really bought the smuggled goods he brought for the school at the price Li Mei-ting asked for, he became angry again. He thought that Li Mei-ting would get compensation, and he was the only one who suffered. On the evening of Gao Songnian's post, he received a dinner for the new professor. Hung-chien was awkward and resigned, so he couldn't stand Hsin-mei's hard persuasion. In the evening, Gao Songnian's relatives bowed back and forth, and finally got face and went.\r\nHsin-mei, unlike Li Mei-ting, doesn't have the essence of China literature, which is refined into an elixir and portable, but he also carries a dozen reference books with him.",

Fang Hung-chien didn't know that he would come to teach ethics, and he didn't need to carry a book like Western Social History, Primitive Culture and Historical Series. After careful consideration, he was too flustered to get angry. He hoped Gao Songnian would allow him to teach comparative cultural history and the history of China literature, but the former course is not needed now, and the latter course is taken by someone. Beggars can only get what they want, but it's not his turn to order. Hsin-mei comforted him by saying, \"The level of students nowadays is not the same as before-\"The level of students and the people in the world seem to be the only two retrogressive things in this big era with rubber wheels-\"Don't panic, you can handle it anyway.\" Hung-chien went to the library to look for books, but there were no more than 1,000 books in the library, and most of them were old, bad and worn-out Chinese textbooks, all of which were the legacy of schools that were closed because of the war. A thousand years later, these books must be as valuable as the papers in Dunhuang stone chambers. Now, they are ancient but not rare, and short-sighted bibliophiles don't know how to buy them. All libraries used to be like the brains of studying hard for exams, and they were the graves of learning; This library is like an old-fashioned charity that respects the word paper. If heaven knows it, its staff will never be struck by thunder in this life, and everyone will be smart and doctor in the next life. After searching for a long time, Hung-chien found a Chinese translation of the Outline of Ethics, which was borrowed and returned to his room, much to Tang Sanzang's joy of returning to Chang 'an with Buddhist scriptures. He read a few pages of Outline of Ethics, thinking that students can't buy textbooks in this place, and whether to publish or mimeographed this book and send it to everyone. On second thought, it's unnecessary. Once upon a time, my husband had another reference book as a secret treasure in his pillow, so he was willing to use textbooks; There are no reference books at present, but only this textbook is used to instill knowledge and promote culture. It must not be made public. Let the students be unfathomable, listen to lectures and take notes. If you are an associate professor, you don't have to work too hard. At the first class, he expressed sympathy for the students, lamented the rarity of books in the rear, and then said that under such circumstances, the professor was not a wart, because giving lectures was an emergency measure before printing was invented. Now, unlike in the Middle Ages, everyone has books to read, so it is reasonable not to waste each other's time in class. Hung-chien thought that this would be beautiful to say, but he was too happy to sit still and expected the students' reaction.\r\nHung-chien and others arrived at school on Wednesday, and Kao Sung-nien told them to rest until next Monday. These days, Hsin-mei is the principal's favorite, and his colleagues visit him the most, while Hung-chien's place is seldom visited. This school was founded hastily, and the scale is not large; Except for female students and a few faculty members with families, they all live in a big garden. The contrast between the world and the cold is more and more clear. On Sunday afternoon, when Hung-chien was preparing the lecture notes, Miss Sun came, looking much redder than on the road. Hung-chien was going to call Hsin-mei. Miss Sun said that she had just arrived from Hsin-mei's place, and the professors of the political department were holding a symposium.",

Hung-chien was going to call Hsin-mei. Miss Sun said that she had just arrived from Hsin-mei's place, and the professors of the political department were holding a symposium. The room was full of smoke, so she didn't sit down because there were many people and something to do.\r\nFang Hung-chien said with a smile, \"When politicians get together, it's certainly malodorous.\"\r\nMiss Sun smiled and said, \"I came to thank Mr.Fang and Mr.Zhao today. Yesterday afternoon, the school accounting office sent me my travel expenses. \"\r\n\"Mr.Zhao fought for you, which has nothing to do with me.\"\r\n\"No, I know,\" said Miss Sun gently and firmly. \"You reminded Mr.Zhao of this. You are in the boat-\"Miss Sun realized that she had said half a sentence, blushed, and that sentence was also halved.\r\nHung-chien remembered the conversation on the boat, and sure enough, the girl listened to it all. Seeing her like that, she was embarrassed herself. Shy blushing is as contagious as yawning or stuttering, and the situation is sticky, as if walking in the mud with rubber shoes, unable to step on it and unable to pull it out. He faltered and joked, \"All right, all right. You have the travel expenses for going home. Let's go home early, it's boring here. \"\r\nMiss Sun pouted like a child and said, \"I really want to go home! I miss home every day. I write to my father and say I miss home. It will be too far by next summer vacation, and I will be worried when I think about it. \"\r\n\"Going out for the first time is always like this. It will be fine in a few minutes. Have you talked to your dean? \"\r\n\"I'm scared to death! Mr.Liu asked me to teach a group of English. I really can't teach! Mr.Liu said that each of the four groups of English should have a teacher, and there are only three teachers in the department, so I have to be a group. I really don't know how to teach. All the students are taller than me and look fierce. \"\r\n\"Teaching will teach. I've never taught. I don't think the students' level will be good. You can prepare carefully and teach more than enough. \"\r\n\"I teach a group with the worst English scores in the entrance examination, but, Mr.Fang, you don't know how bad I am. I want to come here and make good use of it for a year or two. Some foreigners won't let her teach, but they want me to lose face! \"\r\n\"What foreigners are there?\"\r\n\"Mr.Fang doesn't know? I haven't seen the wife of Mr.Han, the head of the history department. I heard from Miss Fan that she was all bones and ugly. Some people say that she is Belarus, others say that she is a Jew exiled after Austria was merged into Germany, and her husband says that she is an American. Mr.Han asked her to be a professor in the department of foreign languages, but Mr.Liu refused, saying that she was not qualified and could not speak English, so it was unnecessary to teach German and Russian now. Mr.Han got angry and scolded Mr.Liu for being unqualified and unable to speak English. He compiled several middle school textbooks and mixed a certificate in a foreign summer school. What is it? It's really unpleasant. Finally, Mr.Gao persuaded him to leave. Mr.Han is making a resignation. \"\r\n\"No wonder the headmaster treated him the day before yesterday. Hey! You're really talented. Where did you hear all this information? \"\r\nMiss Sun said with a smile, \"Miss Fan told me. This school is like a big family, unless you live off campus, you can't keep any secrets and talk a lot.

Yesterday, Mr.Liu's sister came from Guilin. I heard that she graduated from the history department. Everyone said that Mr.Liu and Mr.Han can make peace and replace a teaching assistant in the history department with a professor in the foreign languages department. \"\r\nHung-chien dropped the article and said, \"My sister is different from my wife in terms of intimacy; Teaching assistants are inferior to professors. I am your Mr.Liu, and I will never accept this loss. \"\r\nAs he spoke, Hsin-mei came in and said, \"All right, those people have sent them away-Miss Sun, I know you won't just go.\" He said this without any intention, but Miss Sun blushed. Hung-chien quickly told him about Mrs.Han and said, \"Why are there so many political infighting in the school? It is better to enter the officialdom. \"\r\nHsin-mei said as if preaching teachings: \"Where there are people living, there is politics.\" Miss sun went to sit for a while. Hsin-mei said, \"Shall I write to her father and declare that I will hand over the responsibility of protector to you?\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I think this topic is already like what a teacher who teaches Chinese calls' doing death'. There is nothing to say. Why don't you make a joke on another topic?\" Hsin-mei laughed at his nonsense.\r\nAfter more than a week of class, Hung-chien gradually became familiar with several colleagues who lived in the same corridor. Lu Zixiao of the history department once paid a close visit, so one afternoon Hung-chien went to see him. Lu Zixiao's hair is oily and shiny, and he is afraid of being buried by his hat, and he will not live with it, and he will be bald in deep winter. The nose is short and wide, as if it had the original tendency to go straight down. It punched people in the nose and stopped them from moving forward. The nose retreated and flowed to both sides. Because he is not married, his attitude towards his age is inevitably behind the times; At first, he was willing to talk about the full age of foreign algorithms. Year after year, he secretly bought a translated version of \"Life Begins at Forty\" [1], and simply said to others, \"It's very small! Or a little brother! \" At the same time, show the liveliness and playfulness that a little brother should have. He likes whispering when he speaks, as if every sentence is a military secret. Of course, he also knows about military secrets. Doesn't he have relatives in the Executive Yuan and friends in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? His relatives once wrote him a letter, and this big envelope with \"Executive Yuan\" printed on the left corner was written with \"Mr.Lu Zixiao\", as if the Executive Yuan wanted him to be in the center. Although the envelope he wrote to his friend in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not large, the address written on it is \"European and American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\", which is full of pen and ink, and every word is written in block letters. Illiteracy should be clear at a glance in the dark. This letter and a letter are decorated on his desk in turn. The day before yesterday morning, the damn page cleaned up the room, accidentally knocked over the ink bottle, and flooded the Executive Yuan. Lu Zixiao couldn't save it, and jumped up and cursed it. The relative forgot his home and never came to the second letter; That friend is too busy outside to take care of herself, and has never answered a letter. From then on, Lu Zixiao could only write to the Executive Yuan, and both letters on his desk were written. Today is the day to send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Zi Xiao waited for Hung-chien to see the envelope on the desk, put it in the drawer and said, \"It's irrelevant.",
        "fa294b1b-b314-4094-8f5e-d30a40608ef2": "Illiteracy should be clear at a glance in the dark. This letter and a letter are decorated on his desk in turn.

A friend asked me to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and write back to him. \"\r\nHung-chien believed it, so he had to make a farewell and comfort look and said, \"Ouch! What's the matter? Mr.Lu is going to be promoted! Will the headmaster let you go? \"\r\nZi Xiaolian shook his head and said, \"Nothing! It's no fun being an official. I wrote back to insist. President Gao is very kind to others, and several telegrams have urged me to come. Now you are here again, and the school is gradually on track. How dare I tear him down? \"\r\nThinking of Gao Songnian's conversation with himself, Hung-chien sighed, \"Of course, the headmaster treats your husband differently. Like us-\"\r\nZi Xiao spoke in a low voice, as if his thoughts were breathing: \"Yes. That's the problem with the headmaster. What he said is not accurate. I know that your business is very unfair. \" It's as secret as eavesdropping ears hanging all over the walls.\r\nHung-chien didn't expect people to know about himself long ago. His face turned slightly red and said, \"I don't have anything. But Mr.Gao-I finally learned a lesson. \"\r\n\"Where! Of course, the associate professor is a little crooked, but your treatment is the highest among the associate professors. \"\r\n\"What? Is the associate professor still graded? \" Hung-chien has the style that Dr. Johnson disdains to classify bedbugs and fleas.\r\n\"Several grades. For example, if you come together, Gu Erqian of our department is two grades lower than you. Just like the dean, our dean, Mr.Han, is one level higher than Mr.Zhao, and Mr.Zhao is one level higher than Liu Dongfang of the Foreign Languages Department. There are so many orders here, and your husband has just returned to China to do things, so he can't get it mixed up. \"\r\nWhen Hung-chien heard that he was taller than Gu Erqian, he was a little calmer and asked casually, \"Why is the salary of your department head so high?\"\r\n\"Because he is a doctor, Ph.D. I have never been to the United States, so I have never heard of the university where he graduated. It is said to be very famous. In new york, it is called Clayton University. \"\r\nHung-chien jumped up in fear, as if his privacy had been revealed, and he almost lost his voice and cried, \"What university?\"\r\n\"Clayton University. Do you know Clayton University? \"\r\n\"I know! Hum, me too-\"Hung-chien wished he couldn't bite his tongue, and three words had already leaked out.\r\nZi Xiao obeyed for a reason, like bamboo shoots in yellow mud, with a slightly exposed tip, so he wanted to ask questions to the end. Hung-chien refused to say anything, and the more suspicious he became, the more he wished that he could not take effective punishment from the secret service to extract a confession. Hung-chien went back to his room, angry and laughing. Since Miss Tang questioned him about buying a diploma, he refused to think about his negotiation with the Irish again, and he remembered to forget it. Every time the thought has a tendency to involve it, he quickly shifts his mind, but he has a slight fever of shame. Lu Zixiao's words were like a piece of medicine, which laid the ghost in my heart in half. Han Xueyu didn't tell his lies in collusion with himself, but with him, it seems that his deception has lightened the charges. Of course, a new kind of unhappiness is added, but this kind of unhappiness is unpredictable and can be seen in the light of day.",
        "3e5e5541-b1fd-4c4c-8d33-743ab812640e": "Hung-chien refused to say anything, and the more suspicious he became, the more he wished that he could not take effective punishment from the secret service to extract a confession.

Of course, a new kind of unhappiness is added, but this kind of unhappiness is unpredictable and can be seen in the light of day. It is no different from buying a diploma like murdering a dead body, and you have to hide it from yourself. Lying and cheating should be like Han Xueyu, and you should have the courage to stick to it. I'm so hopeless that I have to tell my conscience when I lie. What a fool. If you simply face up boldly, at least Gao Songnian's bullying can be avoided. The loss of an honest man and the shame of a liar being exposed, these two opposite pains, I actually kill two birds with one stone. It suddenly occurred to Hung-chien that he couldn't even lie recently. Therefore, it suddenly dawned on me that lying is often an expression of happiness, and it is also a kind of creation, just like self-deception in children's games. A person's body and mind are comfortable and full of energy, and he will not put tenacious facts in his eyes and feel that he has the ability to joke about the status quo. When it comes to hardship and poverty, people are short of wisdom and can't tell lies well.\r\nA day later, Han Xueyu came to visit. After Tong Ming, Fang Hung-chien was embarrassed and disappointed with pleasure. The ideal Han Xueyu doesn't know how arrogant and slippery, but he is a taciturn person. He thought Lu Zixiao might remember wrong, and Miss Sun must have believed in rumors. Stupid and simple is Han Xueyu's housekeeping skill. Modern people have two popular beliefs. First: a woman's ugliness is virtue, so a beautiful woman must not be as thoughtful and virtuous as an ugly woman; Second: a man without eloquence means that he has morality, so the mute is the most honest person in the world. Perhaps enough speeches and propaganda have been taken in. Modern people overcorrect, thinking that only people who don't speak can speak the truth accurately, which has caused new officials to take office. When lecturing, everyone says, \"It's not enough to talk about politics.\" I hate that I can't just point to my mouth, my heart and the sky with three gestures. Although Han Xueyu is not dumb, he was born with a stutter. Because he wants to cover up his stuttering, he speaks little, slowly and emphatically, as if every word is guaranteed by his whole personality. A man who doesn't talk easily always makes others think that he is full of hidden wisdom, just like a sealed and locked box, and most people always think that it is full of treasures. When Gao Songnian first met this man in Kunming, he felt that he was sincere and serene, like a gentleman, and he was bald before he got old. It can be seen that there was so much knowledge in his mind that his hair was squeezed out. Take a look at his academic qualifications again. Apart from his doctorate, there is another one: \"His works are scattered in the American Journal of History, Saturday Literature Review and other big publications,\" and he can't help but look at others with special respect. Several people who came to meet with letters of introduction wrote on their resumes that they had \"given lectures\" many times in foreign countries. Gao Songnian himself studied in a small country in Europe, knowing that he often thinks he is giving lectures, and the audience thinks he is learning to speak-he can't speak foreign languages to learn. However, publishing works in major foreign journals requires real talents and practical learning. He asked Han Xueyu, \"Can you take a look at Mr.Wang's masterpiece?\" Han Xueyu said frankly that the magazines were all in his old home in the occupied area, but all the universities in China should subscribe to these two publications, and they should be found nearby, unless the old magazines in the library were lost after this flight.",

Gao Songnian never thought that a liar would be so calm; Books in various universities are scattered, and it is not possible to find that issue of the magazine, but it seems that there are articles by Han Xueyu in it. Han Xueyu did contribute to these publications, but Gao Songnian didn't know that his works were published in the personnel advertisement column of Saturday Literature Review: \"Young people in China are highly educated, and those who are willing to help study the China issue have low fees.\" And the communication column of the Journal of History: \"Han Xueyu Jun asked for this magazine twenty years ago, and he is willing to ask the transferor to contact somewhere in the communication.\" Finally, he heard that Mrs.Han was an American, and he simply changed his face and respected each other. To marry a foreign wife, he had to be proficient in Western learning. Didn't he want to marry a foreign woman when he was young? This man is a dean. He didn't expect this foreign wife to marry Belarus in China at that time.\r\nTalking with Han Xueyu is like watching a slow-motion movie. You can't imagine that a simple sentence requires so much preparation and mobilization of such complicated body mechanisms. If time is given to him, he will have to walk slowly. Han Xueyu's face is gloomy, and he can blend in with the surrounding sky on cloudy days, and he is invisible, which is the first-class protective color. He has only one remarkable thing, a big nucleus in his throat. As he spoke, the nucleus of the larynx rose and fell, and Hung-chien felt his throat itch. When he didn't speak and swallowed, the nucleus reappeared slightly, reminding Hung-chien of the sight of frogs swallowing flies. Seeing that he talked less and worked harder, Hung-chien wished he could pull out the Adam's apple like a cork, so as to make the following words loose. Han Xueyu invited Hung-chien to his house for dinner. Hung-chien thanked him, but Han Xueyu was too scared to talk again. Hung-chien had to make excuses and asked, \"I heard that your wife was married in America?\"\r\nHan Xueyu nodded, stretched out his neck and swallowed, and a word floated down from the throat nucleus: \"Has your husband been to the United States?\"\r\n\"I haven't been there-\"I just tried to sound him out-\"But I wanted to go there once, and I used to correspond with a Dr.Mahoney.\" Are you nervous? Han Xueyu seems to have a reddish face, like the sun suddenly shining on a cloudy day.\r\n\"This man is a liar.\" Han Xueyu's voice was not excited, and his speech did not increase.\r\n\"I know. What Clayton University! I was taken in by him. \" Hung-chien thought, if this man is willing to call the Irishman a \"liar\", he must know that he can't hide it from himself.\r\n\"You didn't fall for it! Clayton is a good school. He is a dismissed clerk in this school. You really didn't fall for it by cheating people who don't know abroad under the guise? Well, that's best. \"\r\n\"Really have Clayton this school? I thought it was all the Irish. \" Hung-chien stood up in surprise.\r\n\"A very serious and strict school, although few people know it-ordinary students are not easy to enter.\"\r\n\"I heard from Mr.Lu that you graduated from this school.\"\r\n\"yes.\"\r\nHung-chien is full of doubts and really wants to ask a detailed question. But when we first met, I was embarrassed to pursue it, but I saw that I didn't believe him. And this person speaks very economically and can't ask anything; It's best to have a chance to look at his diploma and know that his Clayton is one or two. On the way home, Han Xueyu felt a little limp.",

And this person speaks very economically and can't ask anything; It's best to have a chance to look at his diploma and know that his Clayton is one or two. On the way home, Han Xueyu felt a little limp. He thought that Lu Zixiao's report was accurate. This Fang had made representations with the Irish. Fortunately, he didn't like to have been to the United States, so he hated not knowing whether he really didn't buy a diploma. Maybe he was lying.\r\nFang Hung-chien was very satisfied with the dinner of the Han family. Although Han Xueyu doesn't talk, the customer's actions are very thoughtful; Although Mrs.Han is ugly, with red hair and freckles, she is as lively as electricity, like dung from flies on bread. Hung-chien found that westerners are ugly different from China people: China people are as ugly as the result of the creator's cutting corners, and the ugliness is sloppy; The ugliness of westerners is a malicious expression of the creator, deliberately joking with the five senses on his face, so it is planned and effective. Mrs.Han keeps saying that she loves China, but she says that living and eating in China is not as convenient as in new york. Hung-chien always felt that her accent was not authentic enough, and she had never been to the United States. If Zhao Xinmei were here, she would have recognized it. Maybe she immigrated to new york. No one has ever been so attentive to him since he arrived at school, and the boredom of the past few days has gradually dissipated. He thinks that Han Xueyu's diploma is fake, whatever, anyway, this person is better with himself. However, there is one thing. When Mrs.Han talked about new york, Han Xueyu winked at her. This wink did not escape her eyes. At that time, she had an impression, as if she overheard someone talking about herself behind her back. This may be your own oversensitive, don't think about it. In high spirits, Hung-chien went to see Hsin-mei before returning to his room. \"Lao Zhao, I'm back. I'm sorry for you today, leaving you to eat alone. \"\r\nBecause Han Xueyu didn't invite himself, Hsin-mei ate a cold, hard-packed meal alone. The food he ate was sour in his stomach, and the food he didn't eat was sour in his heart. He said, \"The international guests are back! Did you have a good meal? Is it Chinese food or western food? Did Mrs.Yang entertain you well? \"\r\n\"Chinese food cooked by his big momma at home. Mrs.Han is so ugly! Such an ugly wife can be married in China, so why go abroad to find treasure! Hsin-mei, I hate that you're not here today-\"\r\n\"Hum, thank you-who else is there today? Only you! That's amazing! Han Xueyu went from the principal to his colleagues, and ignored everyone, so he perfunctory you alone. Is Mrs.Yang related to you? \" Hsin-mei appreciates his humor and can't laugh.\r\nHung-chien was proud of what Hsin-mei said, pretending to be unconvinced, and said, \"An associate professor is not a person? Only you big directors and professors deserve to make friends with each other? Seriously, Hsin-mei, with you today, Mrs.Han's nationality problem can be solved. You are an old American. Listen to her and ask her a few questions, and the truth will come out. \"\r\nAlthough Hsin-mei thought this sentence was pleasant to hear, he was unwilling to give up his unhappiness at once: \"You really have no conscience. After eating people's food, you have to mind your own business and pry into their private affairs. As long as a woman can be a wife, she doesn't care about Americans or Russians.",
        "64724585-fe2c-4807-aa49-1c5b03aeb469": "Is Mrs.Yang related to you? \" Hsin-mei appreciates his humor and can't laugh.\r\nHung-chien was proud of what Hsin-mei said, pretending to be unconvinced, and said, \"An associate professor is not a person?

After eating people's food, you have to mind your own business and pry into their private affairs. As long as a woman can be a wife, she doesn't care about Americans or Russians. Is it because Americans have doubled the composition of women? Will the efficiency of raising children be different? \"\r\nHung-chien said with a smile, \"I am interested in Han Xueyu's student status. I always have a feeling that if his wife's nationality is false, then his student status is also problematic. \"\r\n\"I advise you to save something. You see, you can't tell a lie. I've been suspicious of others since I played a ghost-I know you're joking about it, but how much trouble it takes to make a joke! If you behave like us, you won't be suspicious. \"\r\nHung-chien said angrily, \"What a beautiful speech! Why did I tell you that Han Xueyu's salary was one level higher than yours, and you were so angry that you refused to do it? \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"I'm not that stingy-it's all your fault. I heard a lot of gossip and told me, otherwise I'd be clean-hearted and wouldn't care about anyone.\"\r\nHsin-mei has learned a new attitude. When he listens, he lies in his chair and closes his eyes. Only the cigarette seal in his pipe shows that he is not asleep. Hung-chien was not happy after reading it early, and he couldn't stand these words: \"Good, good! I'll talk to you later. I'm not human. \"\r\nSeeing that Hung-chien was really angry, Hsin-mei quickly opened his eyes and said, \"Just kidding, don't be so angry that you get stomach trouble. Have a cigarette. I'm afraid I can't go to others for dinner in the future! You didn't see the notice? Yes, you won't send it. A school affairs meeting will be held the day after tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the tutorial system. I heard that the tutor will have dinner with the students. \"\r\nHung-chien returned to his room sullenly. It's a rare joy to find a friend to sweep away the fun. Born to teach them to be lonely, one by one should return to each other and die of old age. What the body can't hold, or digestion, or excretion, is a personal matter; Why do you have to find a partner to share the feelings that you can't hold in your heart? When we get together, we always offend others, or people offend ourselves, just like hedgehogs, so we have to keep our distance from each other and be close and United. Either you sting my flesh or I scratch your skin. Hung-chien really wants to talk about these feelings with someone who can understand them. Miss Sun seems to know herself better than Zhao Xinmei. At least she is very interested in listening to her own words-but just now, people should avoid contact with each other. How can she find a woman? Maybe men are like hedgehogs with men, and men are like women-Hung-chien can't think of anything like it, so he opened his notes to prepare for tomorrow's homework.\r\nThe lessons taught by Hung-chien are still three hours. When colleagues talk about it, everyone admires his leisure in person, but it seems that Gao Songnian is selfish and gives him special treatment. Hung-chien had no research on ethics and no reference at hand. Although he worked hard to prepare, he was not interested. These students come to his class for credit at all. According to the school charter, students in the law school should choose one of the four courses: physics, chemistry, biology and theory. Most people rushed to take the course of Theory: this course is the easiest-\"all nonsense\"-not only you don't have to do experiments, but you can also do nothing without taking notes when it's cold.",

Because this course is easy, they choose it; Because this course is easy, they look down on it, just as men look down on women who are easy to get. Ethics is \"nonsense\", and the person who teaches ethics is of course \"waste\" and \"just an associate professor\" and does not belong to any department. In their minds, Hung-chien's position is not much higher than that of those who teach Party righteousness and military training. However, those who teach party righteousness and military training are sent by government agencies, and Hung-chien's origins are not as great as these. \"I heard that it was Zhao Xinmei's cousin who followed him; Gao Songnian only hired him as a lecturer, and Zhao Xinmei won the associate professor for him. \" No wonder Hung-chien always thinks that the students in the class don't take listening to lectures seriously. In this air, reading will not be strong. Even more hateful ethics is the most boring at the beginning. When it comes to syllogism, you can intersperse some jokes, but you can't cater to psychology for the time being. In addition, there are two things that make Hung-chien uneasy.\r\nOne is roll call. Hung-chien remembers that the famous professors in his teacher never called the roll and never reported the absence of students. This is the demeanor of a great scholar: \"Come and listen if you want, I don't care.\" When he is envious, he can't help imitating. In the first lesson, he sang the names of newborn animals like Adam, the primitive man in Genesis, and he didn't even take the roll-call book with him. By the second week, he found that seven or eight of the more than 50 students were absent. These empty seats were like a mouth full of teeth, leaving holes, which made him uncomfortable. Next time, he noticed that the female students were still clinging to the original seats in the first row. The male students seemed to sit up from the last row, leaving the second row empty, and a male student was sitting alone in the third row. I was observing this battle. The male students bowed their heads with a naughty smile, while the female students looked back with their own eyes and turned to look at themselves and smiled. He finally held back and said, \"Obviously, I have more power to reject you than to attract you from my female classmates.\" He wants to call the roll in the future. At this rate, there are only chairs and tables with feet that can't run away. However, from the laissez-faire of great scholars to the triviality of primary school teachers, what a shame! These students are cunning, but they must have seen through their intentions.\r\nOne is to tell books. It seems that the size of the material is not enough and it is necessary to make clothes that fit the body. I thought I had prepared enough materials, but I didn't find myself talking fast until class. My notes were almost the same, and the bell didn't ring for a while. A blank time with nothing to say, like a long piece of water, came straight to the car with full motor, looking anxious and nowhere to escape. I found something to talk about in my confusion, but I couldn't say a few words. I stole a look at my watch and only dragged on for half a minute. At this time, my body was hot, my face was reddish, my speech began to stutter, and I felt that the students were laughing internally. On one occasion, it was like a person who had been hungry for a few days taking laxatives, so he couldn't squeeze it out if he wanted to, so he had to leave class for a quarter of an hour early.",
        "e344c768-5efd-439d-8a10-940cde38d1df": "I thought I had prepared enough materials, but I didn't find myself talking fast until class.

On one occasion, it was like a person who had been hungry for a few days taking laxatives, so he couldn't squeeze it out if he wanted to, so he had to leave class for a quarter of an hour early. Talking to Hsin-mei, I know he feels the same way, saying that after all, beginners are inexperienced. Hsin-mei also said, \"Now I understand why foreigners want to say' kill time' and feel sad for a few minutes before the bell rings! I really hate that I can't cut it in two. \" Hung-chien recently invented a method. Although it can't kill time at once, at least it will suffer some fatal injuries. He always writes on the blackboard, and it takes ten words to write a word on the blackboard. My face is covered with white powder and my arms are sore for a long time. It's all worth it, at least I won't leave early in the future. However, these students are not interested in taking notes; Often he speaks very hard, and a few people sit and don't write a word. His eyes stare menacingly, and they are lazy to draw words on the book. Hung-chien was angry and thought that he could never be worse than Li Meiting, but in Li Meiting's \"History of Pre-Qin Novels\" class next door, the students laughed endlessly, and his class was so listless.\r\nHe thought that when he was studying at school, he was not a bad student, so why he was not so good at teaching. Don't you need \"other talents\" to teach like poetry? I only regret studying abroad and didn't come back with the title of an expert. I can be prestigious and open several courses with all the notes of foreign teachers' speeches. I don't have to help others with the rest of the subjects. However, Li Meiting is a professor for many years and has ready-made handouts. I am inexperienced and unprepared, and the lessons I teach are not voluntary. I have no books to refer to, so of course I can't teach well. If we muddle through this year, Gao Songnian keeps his word, promotes himself as a professor, and goes back to Shanghai to read some foreign books in the summer vacation, I don't believe it will be inferior to Li Meiting next school year. Thinking like this, Hung-chien regained his self-esteem. In the year since he returned to China, he has become much more distant from his father. In the past, he would tell Fang Tun-weng everything. Now he can imagine Tun Weng's reply. Tun Weng was in a good mood, so he comforted his son and said, \"The ruler is short, the inch is long, and scholars may not be good teachers.\" This is enough to make people feel ashamed; He is in a bad mood, so he must blame his son for not studying hard in the past, cramming when he is in a hurry, and maybe there are a bunch of lessons of \"learning while learning\". This is what I said to the students at the memorial week. I am tired of listening in the faculty seats, so I don't have to travel all the way to attract them.\r\nThe day before the school affairs meeting, Hung-chien and Hsin-mei agreed to go to town for dinner, fearing that this freedom would be lost after the tutorial system was implemented. In the afternoon, Lu Zixiao came to chat and asked Hung-chien if he knew about Miss Sun. When Hung-chien asked him what it was, Zi Xiao said, \"If you don't know, forget it.\" Hung-chien knew Zi Xiao's temper and didn't ask. After a while, Zi Xiao looked at Hung-chien sharply, as if to see him wear it, and said, \"You really don't know? How can it be? \" Tell him to keep it a secret, and then tell it.",

As soon as the Academic Affairs Office announced that Miss Sun was teaching English to Group D, the students of Group D held an emergency meeting and sent representatives to the principal and dean to protest. The reason is: everyone is a student, and the authorities should not discriminate. Why is the associate professor teaching English in the side group and only one teaching assistant in the D group? They know that their level is not good, so they plausibly say that they must be taught by a good professor. Thanks to Gao Songnian's ability, he bounced down. Students are not afraid of Miss Sun, and the class order is not good. It is simply unacceptable to give a speech. Miss Sun asked Director Liu of the Department of Foreign Languages for permission. Instead of asking the students in Group D to write, she asked them to practice making sentences. When the students learned about the uproar, they asked Miss Sun why others wrote a composition, but they made partial sentences and treated the students among them. Miss Sun said, \"Because you can't write.\" They said, \"I can't write, so I have to learn to write.\" Miss Sun was so loudly shouted by them that she had to ask Director Liu to explain it before the game was over. Today is the day of composition. When Miss Sun entered the class, she saw the words written on the blackboard: \"Beat down Miss S. Miss S. Is Japanese Enmy!\" [2] The students are smiling and looking forward to it. Miss Sun asked them to make sentences, but they all said they didn't bring any paper, so they only practiced orally. She asked a student to say that three people are more than a few, and the student said in one breath, \"I am your hubband. You are my wife. He is also your hubband. We are your many hubbands,-\"[3] The whole class was convulsed with laughter, and Miss Sun rushed out of the classroom. I don't know how this will end. Zi Xiao also declared: \"This student is from China Literature Department. I personally lectured the students of our history department once, advising them not to mess around in Miss Sun's class, arousing people's misunderstanding about Mr.Han, thinking that he wanted his wife to teach this group and encouraging the students of our department to drive Miss Sun away. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I don't know anything. Miss Sun and I haven't seen each other for a long time. What a thing! \"\r\nZi Xiao gave Hung-chien a sharp look and said, \"I thought you met frequently.\"\r\nHung-chien was just saying, \"Who told you that?\" Miss sun is here. Zi Xiao hurried to sit down, and when he went out, he tilted his head and nodded at Hung-chien, indicating that he had exposed Hung-chien's lies. Hung-chien didn't have time to pay attention, so he asked Miss Sun how she was recently. Miss Sun suddenly stopped turning her face, pressed her handkerchief to her mouth, stirred up her shoulders, and sobbed. Hung-chien hurried to call Hsin-mei. When they came in, Miss Sun stopped crying. Hsin-mei made it clear, and after a long time of soothing words, Hung-chien stayed with him. Hsin-mei said sternly, \"This kind of student must be dealt with strictly. I'll talk to the headmaster tonight-have you told Mr.Liu?\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"It's not a question of punishing students. Miss Sun's class must not be taught. You should ask the headmaster to find someone to take her place, and declare that the school is sorry for Miss Sun. \"\r\nMiss Sun said, \"I will never teach them again. I really want to go home! \"",
        "8d656f4e-fcf0-4716-a56c-6645cf103b38": "Miss Sun suddenly stopped turning her face, pressed her handkerchief to her mouth, stirred up her shoulders, and sobbed.

I really want to go home! \" The voice choked again.\r\nHsin-mei quickly said it was a trivial matter and invited her to dinner with him. She was still hesitating, and the principal's office sent a post to Hsin-mei. Gao Songnian got a banquet for the counselor sent by the Ministry to inspect today, and all the directors had to accompany him, asking Hsin-mei to entertain him at this time. Hsin-mei said, \"Damn it! I can't have dinner today, \"followed the school boy. Hung-chien invited Miss Sun to dinner, but she was not enthusiastic. She said to take a rain check and go back to the dormitory. Seeing that her face was yellow and swollen, Hung-chien asked her if she wanted to wash her face. Without waiting for her answer, he picked out an unused new towel and pulled out the plug of the thermos. When she was washing her face, Hung-chien looked out of the window, thinking that Hsin-mei would know and misunderstand. He thought it was enough to wash her face, and then he turned around and found her opening her handbag, looking in the small mirror, applying powder and lipstick. Hung-chien was surprised. He didn't expect Miss Sun to carry such a complete outfit. She usually thought that her unadorned face turned out to be a work of art..\r\nWhen Miss Sun's face was repaired, the color of her cheeks and mouth was highlighted, and her upper eyelid, which was slightly red from crying, seemed to be painted with rouge, which unexpectedly added some evil spirit to her innocent face. Hung-chien saw her out and passed Lu Zixiao's room. The door was ajar, and Zixiao was sitting in a chair smoking. Seeing Hung-chien and Hung-chien, he quickly stood up and nodded, and then sat down, as if there was a spring to put it away. Within a few steps, I heard someone calling from behind. Looking back, I saw Li Meiting with a smug face. I told them that Gao Songnian had just asked him to act as the dean, and it would be officially published tomorrow. At this time, I would like to go to the reception room to inspect the school. With black glasses, Mei Ting looked at Miss Sun like a telescope and said with a smile, \"Miss Sun is getting more and more beautiful! Why don't you come and see me, just Xiao Fang? When did you two get engaged? \"Hung-chien hissed at him and he ran away laughing.\r\nHardly had Hung-chien returned to his room when Lu Zixiao came in and said, \"Hey, I thought you had dinner with Miss Sun. Why didn't you go? \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I can't afford it. I'm no bigger than your professor. Waiting for you to come. \"\r\nZi Xiao said, \"It doesn't matter if I invite you. I'm afraid people may not appreciate it. \"\r\n\"Who? Miss sun? I see you care about her very much. Do you take a fancy to her? Haha, let me introduce it. \"\r\n\"Nonsense nonsense! I'm getting married. I'm already married. Hey,' once the sea was difficult for water'! \"\r\nHung-chien said with a smile, \"Who taught you to set your sights so high? Miss Sun is very good. I have come all the way with her, and I can guarantee her temper-\"\r\n\"I'm going to get married, I got married long ago,\" as if the needle ran into an obstacle on the record when I turned on the phonograph and said a word again and again.\r\n\"It doesn't matter if you know each other.\"\r\nZi Xiao looked at Hung-chien suspiciously and said, \"Aren't you on good terms with her?",
        "7c8ae682-49f4-4285-9a49-d912b857b1b0": "I'm afraid people may not appreciate it. \"\r\n\"Who? Miss sun? I see you care about her very much. Do you take a fancy to her?

I'm not coming to steal people's love. People abandon me and take it, and I will not come. \"\r\n\"Hang it all! You are too mean. \"\r\nZixiao said that he was joking and would treat you in a couple of days. When Zi Xiao went away, Hung-chien thought it was funny. Miss Sun will be happy to know that someone loves her, and this news can reduce her sadness. But Lu Zixiao doesn't deserve her. She won't take a fancy to him. It's better for her to marry someone, and it's too much for her to feel angry when she does things. These students are really difficult to deal with, which makes you have a headache. Their slogans written on the blackboard are very fluent in arts and sciences. Miss Sun should console herself and make fun of her when she is calm.\r\nHsin-mei came back from dinner drunk and asked Hung-chien, \"Have you been to Oxford and Cambridge in England? What about their tutorial system[4]? \" Hung-chien said that he had traveled to Oxford for a day, but he didn't know the details of the tutorial system. He asked Hsin-mei why he wanted to inquire. Hsin-mei said, \"Today, that distinguished guest inspector is an expert in tutorial system. Last year, he was ordered by the Ministry to study tutorial system in England, and he lived in Oxford and Cambridge.\"\r\nHung-chien said with a smile, \"There are no experts in the tutorial system! Don't any students in Oxford or Cambridge know better? These educators are good at bluffing. At this rate, there will be experts who study abroad and study as principals. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"I dare not agree with that. I think the education system is worth studying, just as officials may not all know the advantages and disadvantages of government organizations. \"\r\n\"Well, I won't argue with you. Who doesn't know that you are a political scientist? Let me ask you, what does this expert say? Is his coming here related to tomorrow's meeting? \"\r\n\"Tutorial system is a new policy of the Ministry of Education. It seems that the response is not very good to inform universities to implement it. President Gao is the most enthusiastic person here-I forgot to tell you that the blind man Li has become the dean. Hey, you know-the Ministry of Education dropped in to give guidance. He will attend the meeting tomorrow, but what he said today is not very clever. According to him, the tutorial system in Oxford and Cambridge has many shortcomings, which is far from the ideal of teachers and students living together, so we have adopted a plan improved by him and approved by the Ministry of Economy. In Oxford and Cambridge, each student has two tutors, one is academic tutor and the other is moral tutor. He believes that this is not in line with the educational principle. The teacher should be a' teacher by the teacher' and have both character and learning, so each person designates a tutor, which is the teacher of the department; In this way, knowledge and morality can be integrated. Britain's moral tutor is nominal; The student got into trouble in the street and was taken away by the police. He went to the police station to bail. The student owed money to the store and couldn't pay it back. He vouched for him. Mentors like us have a much greater responsibility to investigate, correct and report students' thoughts to the authorities anytime and anywhere. These are all red tape articles, needless to say, he still has a proud pen. The English tutor talked to the students while smoking a pipe. This is the most contrary to the' new life movement', so we must never smoke in front of students, and it is best to give up smoking at all.",

He smoked one cigarette after another and packed a box of matches before he left. Mr.English only eats dinner with students and eats at different tables. Mr.English sits on the stage and eats, and the teacher-student gap is very thin. This has to be improved, so that we can eat three meals a day at the same table with the students-\"\r\n\"Just sleep with the students!\"\r\nHsin-mei said with a smile, \"I said it at that time. You haven't heard what the blind man Li said! He complimented the scholar, and then said that both Chinese and western civilized countries are strict with men and women. Love between teachers and students is harmful to the dignity of teachers, and it is absolutely unacceptable. To prevent problems before they happen, unmarried husbands should not be tutors for female students. I was so angry that they all smiled at me-of all the deans and department heads, only I was not married. \"\r\n\"Ha ha, wonderful! However, if an unmarried man teaches girls the danger of teacher-student love, and a married man teaches girls the possibility of committing bigamy, he didn't expect it. \"\r\n\"I questioned him at that time, and the person who got married and didn't bring his wife did a bad job as a tutor for female students. He faltered and asked me not to get me wrong. This blind man is such an asshole. One day, I publicized the jokes about Suzhou widow and Wang Meiyu who came from the same way for him. Scared, and he said that male and female colleagues should not be too close, which has a bad impression on students-\"\r\nHung-chien jumped up and said, \"This clearly refers to what I said to Miss Sun. The blind man just saw me with her.\"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"It doesn't necessarily mean you. I think Kao Sung-nien's face changed at that time, and there was always something in it. But I advise you to propose, get engaged and get married quickly. In this way, blind Li can't gossip, and-\"raise your hand and open your mouth when you talk-\"you have a chance to commit bigamy. \"\r\nHung-chien forbade him to talk nonsense and asked him if he had told Gao Songnian about students insulting Miss Sun. Hsin-mei said that Kao Sung-nien knew about it long ago and was going to expel the student. Hung-chien also told him that Lu Zixiao was interested in Miss Sun, and Hsin-mei said that his \"uncle\" only appreciated Hung-chien. After joking for a while, Hsin-mei said before he left, \"Alas, I forgot the most wonderful thing. One of the' Sketch of Tutorial Rules' promulgated by the Ministry says: If a student commits a crime in society after graduation, the tutor will be jointly and severally responsible! \"\r\nHung-chien was stunned. Hsin-mei said, \"You see, the tutorial system has become such a thing. Once upon a time, Emperor Chengzu of Ming Dynasty killed ten families in Fang Xiaoru. It was said that Mr.Fang Xiaoru was implicated in killing them. Will anyone dare to teach in the future? I will definitely object to the meeting tomorrow. \"\r\n\"Boy! The Nazi party education system I heard in Germany is not so interesting. Is this the tutorial system in Oxford and Cambridge? \"\r\n\"Hum, Kao Sung-nien asked me to write an English article and publish it in a foreign magazine to let westerners know that we also have Oxford and Cambridge style of study. Somehow, all foreign good things come to China without losing their shape. \" Hsin-mei sighed, thinking that China is really interested.",

One foreign thing comes and one is destroyed.\r\nHung-chien said, \"You used to praise your teacher Gao for his good mind. I came here this time, and what he did was not brilliant.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Maybe I was young and inexperienced at that time and didn't see people clearly. However, I think Gao Songnian's status has been high in recent years. If a person has a high status, he will become confused. \" In fact, a person's shortcomings are just like a monkey's tail. When the monkey squats on the ground, the tail is invisible. Until he climbs to the tree, he puts the back for the public to admire. However, this long tail with red buttocks is already there, which is not a new sign of climbing up.\r\nThis is how the China literature student who made trouble with Miss Sun handled it. Liu Dongfang, director of the Department of Foreign Languages, advocated dismissal, while Wang Chuhou, director of the Department of Chinese Languages, opposed it. Zhao Xinmei refused to come forward because Miss Sun was her own private, and only secretly sponsored Liu Dongfang's idea. Li Meiting, the dean of discipline, came out to clear the air, saying that the student's rudeness was because he was not influenced by his tutor, and he was ignorant. He who didn't know it was not guilty, so he could forgive him and forget it once. He told the student to go to his bedroom for a long time and tell him how everyone would fire him. Wang Chuhou had no choice but to save himself. The student thanked him with red eyes. Miss Sun's class has no one to take her place. Liu Dongfang is afraid that Mrs.Han will take advantage of it and take her place in person. The national university she hates is not as good as the private university, and her salary is fixed, so she will not get a raise because of the extra hours. After a week's class, Liu Dongfang got bored, thinking that he was so stupid. It was a waste of time and effort, and he couldn't get a good word. If the school really can't find a substitute, this time it seems that the person who is the head of the department is willing to work hard for the sake of students' studies. Now there is a Mrs.Han, who has come to substitute for her, asking for two seats on her ass. People all know that it is a portal opinion, and she is too busy to show her merit. Zhao Xinmei, a colleague, is famous for his English, and he only attends his homework at six o'clock. I asked him to take Miss Sun's class with him, but I don't know if he promised or not. Isn't miss sun the person in his face? She can't teach like this. Shouldn't the sponsor be responsible? Of course, Zhao Xinmei's English seems to be better than his own-Liu Dongfang has to admit it-but the students in Group D are not good enough to distinguish between good and bad, not to mention that they are all collateral students, and their prestige in the department will not be shaken. Liu Dongfang had made up his mind, so he proposed to Kao Sung-nien first, and Kao Sung-nien invited Zhao Xinmei to discuss with him. Because of Miss Sun, Hsin-mei couldn't refuse categorically, so he had a brainwave and recommended Fang Hung-chien. Song nian said, \"well, that's a good idea. Mr.Fang has too few hours. I wonder how his English is?\" Hsin-mei said with a mouthful, \"Very well,\" thinking that Hung-chien always had plenty of room to teach such students.",

Hung-chien knew that his position in the school was unstable, and after Hsin-mei explained his interests in detail, Liu Dongfang earnestly advised him to drive, so he dared to face up and bow his head to teach English carefully. As soon as this matter was published, Han Xue came to see Gao Songnian more and more, stating that his wife never wanted to teach English here, and that he had no resentment against Liu Dongfang and was willing to ask Miss Liu to be a teaching assistant in the history department. Gao Songnian likes to say, \"Colleagues should help each other with one heart and one mind, and you must hire your wife for help next school year.\" Han Xueyu proudly said, \"It is still a problem whether I will stay or not next school year. Uni-President University sent me five or six letters asking me to go with my wife. \" Kao Sung-nien urged him not to leave. There is always a way to deal with his wife next school year. Hung-chien went to the office of the Department of Foreign Languages to discuss his homework. When he met Miss Sun, he joked in a low voice, \"It's all your fault-do you want me to avenge you?\" Miss Sun just laughed and didn't answer. Lu Zixiao didn't mention inviting me to dinner again.\r\nAt the seminar on tutorial system, the Ministry of Education first gave a ten-minute high-sounding speech, with an average of one and a half words per minute \"when my brother was in England\". He looked at his watch and then walked out. All the coughs and coughs held back in the throat of the audience are released, and this is another. At the general assembly, after three minutes' silence and the chairman's report, there was such a cough as usual. In addition to coughing a few times, everyone changed to a more comfortable sitting position. Gao Songnian continued his speech, and many times expounded the relationship between cells and organisms, hoping that everyone would sacrifice their own convenience for group life. Read out the outline of the Ministry and the detailed rules drawn up by Li Meiting for discussion. At all meetings, the pros and cons of the proposal are rarely practical. Some people object to this proposal because they are quarrelling with the proposer. Some people who agree with this proposal have a hard time with those who oppose it. Some people go along with the voices because those who are against or in favor have friendship with themselves. Today's discussion is different from usual, and even Liu Dongfang is not in favor of Han Xueyu's opposition. Everyone unanimously protested against the rule that tutors and students have meals together, and those who bring their families make it more difficult. The head of the physics department who didn't bring his family said that unless the school doesn't count the tutor's meals, it can still be considered. Wang Chuhou, who is famous for his meals at home, said that even if the school pays for the meals for the tutors, the tutors still have to have meals at home, so it is not necessary to save rice and firewood. Han Xueyu said that he has stomach trouble and can only eat pasta and rice with his students. Does the school guarantee the safety of his life? Li Meiting insisted that this was a rule issued by the Ministry, except for Saturday dinner and Sunday meals at most. The head of the mathematics department asked him how to assign tutors to the tables, which puzzled him. There are more than 40 professors, associate professors and lecturers who are qualified as tutors, while 130 students in Yu Nan have less than 20 tables. If there is one tutor and six students at each table, there must be twenty tutors who can't eat with the students.",

If there is one tutor and six students at each table, there must be twenty tutors who can't eat with the students. If there is one tutor and seven students at each table, the tutor can't be independent, and this dignity can't be maintained, which will gradually attract students to despise. If there are two tutors and four students at a table, it is said that there are not enough dishes for eight people at a table now, and the number of people decreases and the number of tables increases, so the quality of the dishes must be worse. Is the school going to post more money? With the help of figures, everyone became more confident. Li Meiting was so anxious that she couldn't speak. She took off her black glasses, put them on, and took them off again, staring at Gao Songnian in vain. At this time, Zhao Xinmei made a big argument that students should also be free to eat, and the tutorial system should be protested to the Ministry of Education with the neighboring universities.\r\nFinally, the original draft was revised a lot. It is decided that each tutor will have meals with students at least twice a week, and the date will be arranged by the discipline office; The headmaster has no obligation because of his busy business and entertainment, and he is not a tutor, but he reserves the right to attend dinner at any time. Because of the Ministry theory, in Oxford and Cambridge, teachers bless in Latin before and after meals, which Gao Songnian thinks can be imitated. However, unlike Britain, China has no Christian God to listen to the lower court, and has nothing to say before and after meals. Li Meiting searched his heart, but he just wanted to say, \"A porridge and a meal, it is hard to think.\" Everyone was stunned. The head of the economics department, whose children are swarming, said to himself: \"Just like my son, everyone reads:' Don't run before eating; After eating, don't jump. Gao Songnian winked at him and said seriously, \"I think it is also very interesting for the dean to lead the students to be silent for one minute before sitting down to eat, thinking about the difficulties of people's livelihood during the Anti-Japanese War and how we should serve the country and society when we are full.\" The head of the economics department said quickly, \"I would like to take the chairman's words as my proposal.\" Li Meiting seconded the motion, and Gao Songnian paid the vote and passed it unanimously. Li Mei-ting was thoughtful, expecting many gentlemen to accompany the students for half a bowl of rice, so he put down his chopsticks and slipped out of the dining hall and went back to eat comfortably. He set the dining hall rules: the tutor's meals should be served first by the students at the same table, and the students should wait for the tutor to finish eating and quit the dining hall together. It seems that they are all respecting teachers. Plus combined with the old adage of Kong Old Master Q, \"Eat without language\", you can't talk while eating, but only eat dumb rice. It's really hard to say. As soon as Li Meiting became the dean, she gave up smoking immediately. Seeing that her colleagues still smoked, she was not a model student and wanted to live together with her teachers and students. Knowing that the most harmful part of smoking is the toilet, he used the excuse that there are many students but the toilet is small, and there are few staff on campus but the toilet is big, so teachers and students can share the toilet in the future. He thought that in this way, they would be ashamed of each other and would not smoke casually.",

He thought that in this way, they would be ashamed of each other and would not smoke casually. As a result, Mr.Wang didn't use the students' toilet, but the students crowded into Mr.Wang's toilet and smoked boldly to get rid of the filth, because they knew that this was a more rigorous place than the Forbidden City, where everyone kept his own standards, and no one was willing to meddle or put on airs as a tutor. As usual, the tutor talks with the students once a week, and several gentlemen take this opportunity to invite them to tea for dinner, such as Wang Chuhou and Han Xueyu.\r\nChao Hsin-mei really didn't like it, and told Hung-chien that he was cheated this time and would definitely quit next school year. Hung-chien said, \"When you didn't come, you told me that teaching is the beginning of political activities and teaching students is training cadres. Why are you discouraged now? \" Hsin-mei denied that he had said those words. After Hung-chien argued, he said, \"Maybe I did, but I want to train people, not machines. And this time, another time. At that time, I had no educational experience, so I said those words; Now I know what China's wartime higher education is all about. I've learned well, and of course, it's my progress. Words are empty, people are alive; People don't do what they say, but words change with people. If you say a word, you will do it until you die. There are no many things in the world, such as cancellation, regret, apology and divorce. \" Hung-chien said, \"No wonder your teacher, Mr.Gao, telegraphed me to be a professor, and when he came, he only gave me an associate professor.\" Hsin-mei said, \"But don't forget that he only promised you three hours at first, and now it's increased to six hours. Sometimes a person doesn't want to tell a lie. After speaking, the environment changes and he has to change his original intention. It is especially difficult for administrative people to keep their promises. You just need to read the conversations of government spokespersons in the newspapers every day. For example, if I agree to something with someone, or even sign a contract with him, no matter whether it is written in the contract for ten or twenty years, my motivation for signing the contract is always based on my current hope, understanding and needs. However, the \"present\" is the most unreliable. If this \"present\" has fallen behind, it is useless to write \"until the end of the world\" in the treaty. We can go back on our word at any time. What was the name of the German Chancellor in the first European War? He said' treaties are waste paper', as you always know. I have the impression that everything we say in society is like a ticket to the theater, with the words' expired and invalid' printed on one side, but there is no date on the other side, so we can advance or postpone it as we like. \" Hung-chien said, \"Terrible, terrible! You are like a gentleman and a good friend. I didn't expect you to be so immoral. I'll be careful what you say in the future. \" Hsin-mei heard this negative compliment and said in circles, \"This is called learning! I studied politics and got the first place in my graduation exam. Scared, I know all the tricks played by their politicians. I just quit now. \" He spoke with an expression like Machiavelli's soul attached to him. Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Don't brag. Your politics, I think, is just theory. I told you to kill your conscience, but you wouldn't. You are like a dog that foreigners say, barking fiercely, and it is not harmful to bite people. \"",

Hung-chien quickly stuffed a cigarette into his mouth.\r\nAfter Hung-chien added more hours, his interest recovered a little. He found that in the English class he taught in Group D, three students from Group A came to attend and often asked questions politely. Hung-chien was so proud that he told Hsin-mei. The hard work is to reform the paper, just like washing dirty clothes. One batch is clean, and the next batch is still dirty. Most students look at the scores of the batch and throw away the papers, which makes the teacher have a headache for nothing. Although those students are not good at foreign languages, the foreign names written on their papers are very impressive. Some are called Alexander, some are called Elizabeth, some are called Dick, some are called \"Florrie\", and some are called \"Bacon\" because his China name is \"Bacon\". A student surnamed Huang Ming Bolun, whose foreign name is the poet \"Byron\". Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"If his surname is Zhang, he must be British Prime Minister Chamberlain; If his surname is Qi, he will become a German plane Sieberling; Even he can be called Napoleon, as long as China has a surname similar to the word' take'. \"\r\nThe annual leave in the solar calendar has already passed, and there is still one week before the big exam. One night, Hsin-mei and Hung-chien talked about going to Guilin for the winter vacation, and talked about it until late at night. Hung-chien looked at his watch. It was past one o'clock. Hurry up and get ready for bed. He first went out of the dormitory to the toilet. The upstairs and downstairs of the dormitory slept quietly, and his footsteps were like trampling on the dreams of these sleepers. The shoes with iron heels were too heavy, which would crush several fragile dreams. There is frost all over the door. There are not many bamboo leaves left, and the cold wind occasionally makes it so stupid to blow a few small leaves. Although there is no moon, the bare branches and bones of several buttonwood trees are clear. Only a plant oil lamp hanging in front of the toilet is dim and muddy, which is a little greasy on a refreshing winter night. The smell of the toilet is also like being afraid of the cold, and it can't come out in the house, unlike in summer, where there is a whistle far away. Hung-chien didn't come in, but he heard a speech inside. A humanitarian said, \"What's the matter with you? I have diarrhea several times a night! \" Another person groaned and said, \"I ate something bad at the Han family today-\"Hung-chien distinguished his voice, a student who was auditing his English class. The original humanitarian asked, \"Why does Han Xueyu always invite you to dinner? Is it for Fang Hung-chien-\"The man who hurt his stomach responded with a\" shh \"! Hung-chien's heart jumped with fear, but he couldn't hold his feet, and the two students were silent. Hung-chien seems to have a guilty conscience, and his steps are furtive. Back to the bedroom, all kinds of suspicions, Han Xueyu must be plotting against himself, and he doesn't know how to plot against him. Tomorrow, he will openly tear down his peep show. It was with the hero's determination that Hung-chien fell asleep. He didn't wake up in the morning. The school boy sent a letter, opened it and saw that it was Miss Sun's. He said that he was taking an English class.",

He said that he was taking an English class. In front of the students, Liu Dongfang had known about Liu Dongfang's mistakes in telling books, and asked him to pay attention. Hung-chien lost his voice and called it strange. Where did this come from? I don't know why. I added an enemy. It suddenly occurred to me that the three students who were listening in were all English majors from the history department and Liu Dongfang Group A. Undoubtedly, there was a trap hidden in the questions they sent and they fell into the trap. In the final analysis, it's always Han Xueyu's asshole, who always thought he wanted to make friends with himself and keep secrets for him! The more he thought about it, the more he hated it. He pondered for a long time how to explain it to Liu Dongfang first.\r\nHung-chien went to the office of the Department of Foreign Languages. Miss Sun was reading a book. When she met him, her eyes were full of words. Hung-chien's throat was a little dry, and his hands trembled slightly. He exchanged pleasantries with Dong Liu's general plan, and he got up the courage to say, \"A colleague said outside-I was also handed down to me by others-that Mr.Liu was very dissatisfied with the English I taught. When he was in class in Group A, he often accused the students of my mistakes in telling books-\"\r\n\"What?\" Liu Dongfang jumped up. \"Who said that?\" The expression on Miss Sun's face is all-encompassing, and she even forgets to pretend to read.\r\n\"-I was not good at English. Half of this time I taught English because of Mr.Liu's orders. Of course, I made mistakes. I only hope that Mr.Liu will correct me face to face. However, this colleague heard that he had a little problem with Mr.Liu, and I didn't quite believe what he heard. He also said that the three students in my class were also sent by Mr.Liu as detectives. \"\r\n\"ah? What three students-Miss Sun, go to the library to borrow a-er-er-Selected College English for me, and go to the general affairs department to get-get a hundred manuscripts. \"\r\nMiss sun has gone disgruntled. Liu Dongfang heard that Hung-chien had reported the names of three students and said, \"Brother Hung-chien, just think that all three students are history majors, so how can I call them?\". Is the colleague who spread rumors the head of the history department? You will understand when you gather the facts. \"\r\nHung-chien succeeded in taking the risk, and his hands stopped shaking. He pretended to wake up from a big dream and said, \"Han Xueyu, he-\"and told the whole story about Han Xueyu buying a diploma like a sack full of rice.\r\nLiu Dongfang was pleasantly surprised and repeatedly said \"Oh\"! After listening to it, she said, \"Let me tell you the truth. My sister is in the office of the history department, and she often hears history students tell Han Xueyu that you scold me in class.\"\r\nHung-chien swore that he didn't. Liu Dongfang said, \"Do you expect me to believe that? He's messing with this ghost, not only to get rid of you, but also to ask his wife to cover for you. He thinks he has used my sister, and there will be no substitute at that time. Am I ashamed not to ask his wife? I am the most selfless in employing people, and my sister is not for his personal use. Even if she loses her job, I am determined to do my best to maintain my brother's status. Hey, let me show you something, which was handed down by the principal's office yesterday. \"",

He thinks he has used my sister, and there will be no substitute at that time. Am I ashamed not to ask his wife? I am the most selfless in employing people, and my sister is not for his personal use. Even if she loses her job, I am determined to do my best to maintain my brother's status. Hey, let me show you something, which was handed down by the principal's office yesterday. \"\r\nHe opened the drawer and picked out a pile of paper to show Hung-chien. It's a public presentation from the students of English Group D, and it says, \"Give it to another good teacher to pay attention to academic affairs.\" From the beginning to the end, Hung-chien is not qualified to teach English, and his clerical mistakes and omissions in correcting papers are listed above, which proves that he doesn't know English. Hung-chien blushed at this. Liu Dongfang said, \"Never mind it. The students in Group D are not good enough to do this thing. This must have been the idea of those three listeners, and Han Xueyu might have written it. The headmaster approved it and asked me to check it out. I will definitely defend you. \" Hung-chien was deeply grateful. Before he left, Liu Dongfang asked him if he had told anyone the secret of Han Xueyu, and told him not to tell it. Hung-chien went out and met Miss Sun back. She praised his voice in talking with Liu Dongfang, and he was glad to hear it, but he was ashamed for a long time at the thought that she might have seen the submission. The submission stuck firmly in his mind, like a piece of sticky tape with flies.\r\nLiu Dongfang is really capable. Hung-chien will attend class tomorrow, and the three auditees will not come. Until the big exam, nothing happened. Liu Dongfang taught Hung-chien to be lenient in grading bad papers and tight in grading good papers, because too many people failed, which caused students' ill feelings, while too many people scored well, which also reduced Mr.Wang's prestige. All in all, the batch of scores should be a gift in the snow, and we must not be stingy-in Liu Dongfang's words, \"You can't buy anything for a penny, let alone a score!\" -Don't add icing on the cake, let students treat grades too cheap and homework too easy-in Liu Dongfang's words: \"Give the poor at least one dollar, that's a hundred points, but give students a hundred points, that's not acceptable.\" On the day after the exam, Wang Chuhou met Hung-chien and said that Mrs.Wang wanted to see him and Hsin-mei, and asked them which day they were free during the winter vacation and wanted to invite them to dinner. He heard that the two of them went to Guilin in the winter vacation, touching their beards and laughing, \"What are you going to do?\" My wife is going to match you two. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Life Begins at Forty is an American book that was popular at that time.\r\n[2] Down with Miss S!

He didn't dare to grow the same beard, lest the guard blame him for his arrogance; The prince is Wuling rounded beard, and he just wants to have a smaller Hong Ling pointed beard. Who knows that people who don't have a gun have a decent beard, which is thin and soft, hanging on both sides of the quarrel, like commas in new punctuation, which can neither stand up but also not float and curl. His two thick black eyebrows can compete with the birthday girl's eyebrows, as if he accidentally shaved off his eyebrows and beard at first, and hurriedly installed them, and the beard and eyebrows changed places; The eyebrows on the mouth are not long at all, and the beard on the forehead is thriving. You can keep this beard. He married this lady five years ago, which was just a good excuse to shave. However, like all bureaucrats, robbers, gambler and speculators, he believed in fate. Astrologers all say that he is \"wood\" shaped, and his hair and beard are like branches and leaves of trees. Without them, the trees are withered. Of course, people over forty are half bald, and all these beards mean that the old trees are full of flowers and vitality. But for the sake of the 25-year-old new lady, we can't be stingy, so we shaved off two strands and left the middle one, and because this one was not strong enough, it was trimmed into a movie star-like line. This incident will inevitably ruin the feng shui on the face, and unpleasant things will come one after another. When the new wife entered the house, she fell ill. Wang Chuhou impeached herself, but the official failed. Fortunately, a person who is an official does somersaults, just like a cat falling from a height, and always lands on all fours without being too embarrassed. He doesn't rely on salary, so he explains it. Moreover, he is an old-school celebrity and has the habits of the former Qing Dynasty. When he was an official, he was very elegant. After retiring, he could talk about learning. My wife's illness is always like this, not getting worse. This may still be the effect of that beard, and luck is not bad to the end.\r\nIf these beards can retain some of the luck, Wang Chuhou's good luck is not to mention when the beard is not shaved. For example, his original wife, the dross, died in fun and asked him to marry the beautiful second wife. After more than 20 years of marriage, all her sons graduated from college. This wife should have died. The death of a wife is still the most economical thing. Although the funeral costs a sum of money, is there no alimony for divorce? Don't bigamy cost two things? Many people have damn wives, just like Wang Chuhou has the luck to mourn in time. And at least someone will give gifts in mourning. Divorce and bigamy will have no income even from this gift, and they will also pay legal fees. What's more, although Wang Chuhou is an official, he is only a scholar at heart. Scholars like people to die, so they can write articles on mourning. Coffin shops and funeral homes only deal in the business of new dead people, and literati will grow hair on the old dead people for a year, a few years, decades or even hundreds of years. \"anniversary of death\" and \"300-year sacrifice\" are the same good topics. Dead wife-or dead husband, because there are female writers-this topic is especially good; Although others have literary talent, the wife or husband is only yours, which is the subject of registered patent. When Wang Chuhou wrote poems about his wife's death and mourning in his new funeral, he thought of an ancient saying: \"It's the second time for a bride to have new children.\"",

When Wang Chuhou wrote poems about his wife's death and mourning in his new funeral, he thought of an ancient saying: \"It's the second time for a bride to have new children.\" He only hated that it was not used for a while, and hoped that he would have a child again, and then write a poem about \"The first wife died suddenly\" and put these two sentences in a new guise. This poem has not been done yet. The second wife, Mrs.Wang, went through the door without giving birth, but was ill. Taking care of illness at home has brought this illness to support the family and refused to leave her, so she is very delicate all the year round, which makes her semi-old husband feel pity and fear. She studied in a university for one year, dropped out of school to recuperate because of anemia, and lived at home for four or five years. On days when her head was dizzy and her body was not whining, she learned Chinese painting from her teacher and played the piano for recreation. Chinese painting and piano are the cultural parts of her dowry, such as other women's university diplomas (with ebony frames) and bachelor's hat photography (16-inch color with gold lacquer ebony frames). Wang Chuhou can't understand western music, and of course he thinks his wife plays the piano well. He should know a little about Chinese painting, but his wife's paintings are never bad for her husband. He always said to his guests, \"She likes to make music and draw pictures, which are all painstaking things. How can she be healthy!\" Mrs.Wang said modestly to the guests, \"I am in poor health and can't do these things often, so I can't draw well and play the piano well.\" Since moving to this small village, Mrs.Wang has been lonely and often quarreled with her husband. She has a delicate status and looks down on the wives of her husband and colleagues, feeling that they are cold and embarrassed. Her husband is uneasy that single male colleagues often come to his house and think they are young. Gao Songnian knew that she was bored at home and was willing to invite her to work at school. Mrs.Wang is a smart person and refuses. For one thing, she knew that her qualifications were not good, and it would hurt her dignity to be a small clerk at most. Secondly, She knows that this is a man's world, and countries with developed women's rights, like Britain and the United States, only invite men to be gods, saying only He, not She. When a woman goes out to do things, no matter how high her status is, she is still used by men. Only when she doesn't come out and hide behind the scenes, she can use her qualifications as a wife or mistress to instruct and manipulate men. Miss Fan, a female tutor and lecturer in the Department of Education, is her admirer and has a lot of contacts with each other. Liu Dongfang's younger sister, Wang Chuhou's door-worshipping student, also comes to Jenny's house to talk from time to time. Liu Dongfang once asked Mrs.Wang to act as a matchmaker for her sister. Being a matchmaker and being a mother are two basic desires of women. Mrs.Wang was originally bored and entrusted, as if the unemployed had found a job. There is no danger that Wang Chuhou wants to be a matchmaker, and he will never be a matchmaker himself. Mrs.Wang had long planned to give Miss Fan to Zhao Xinmei and Miss Liu to Fang Hung-chien. Miss Fan is older and uglier than Miss Liu, but she is a lecturer, and the object should be the department head with higher status. Miss Liu is a teaching assistant. It is good enough to marry an associate professor. As for Miss Sun, she has never visited Mrs.Wang. When Mrs.Wang went to see Miss Fan, she would visit her once or twice, and her impression was not very good.",

When Mrs.Wang went to see Miss Fan, she would visit her once or twice, and her impression was not very good.\r\nTwo days after they came back from Guilin, Hung-chien received a post from Wang Chuhou. They have never been in contact with Wang Chuhou and have never met Mrs.Wang. After reading the post, they remembered what they said about matchmaking. Hung-chien said, \"Old man Wang is a big shelf. Only Gao Songnian and the three deans are qualified to go to his house for dinner, and of course there are people from the China Literature Department. You might deserve it. Why did you drag me in? If it's a matchmaker, there are no women here. This old man is really! \" Hsin-mei said, \"It doesn't matter if you pay a visit to Mrs.Wang. Maybe Lao Wang has a niece, niece or aunt-Mrs.Wang heard it's beautiful-and wants to make it for you. Lao Wang said to you, not to me, referring to you alone. You're embarrassed, you faked the imperial edict, dragged me to accompany you, and said you were matchmaking for both of us! I don't want people to be matchmakers. \" After shouting once, I decided to visit Mr.and Mrs.Wang first and ask a question to avoid joking seriously.\r\nThe semi-western flat house rented by Wang family in black brick is the best building outside the school building, which is separated from the school building by a stream. In winter, the stream dries up, and the bottom of the stream is full of stones, like a nest of eggs, large and small, newly born in this stream. When the water dries up, everyone walks across the stream without taking the wooden bridge, which means that as long as there is no danger, everyone is willing to act outside the rules. The Wangs' sitting room is very open, with seats on the brick floor. The old-fashioned tables and chairs made of mahogany are generous and strong. Wang Chuhou bought them from an officer's house in the town, and he can sell them to the school in case he leaves school. Wang Chuhou came out first, all smiles, asked them if it was cold in the guest room, and assigned the maid to carry the brazier. Both of them praised the house he lived in, which was better and more exquisitely decorated, and was second to none among the houses they had seen in the past six months. Mr.Wang sighed proudly, \"This is nothing! I have something, and I lost it all this time. You didn't see my house in Nanjing-it didn't burn down by the Japanese at last, and all the collections and furnishings in it are missing. Fortunately, I am a philosophical person, otherwise I would really be sad to death. \" These words are not only familiar to them recently, but they are also used to saying them themselves. Of course, this military disaster has left many people who have money and houses homeless, and at the same time, it has given many poor people a chance to trace back to their past riches. The Japanese burned down many castles in the air, occupied many utopian industries and destroyed many unrequited love marriages. For example, Lu Zixiao often reveals that two or three women rushed to marry him before the war. \"Of course, it's out of the question now!\" Li Meiting was in Zhabei, Shanghai, and suddenly built a new house. What about now? What a pity! The damn Japanese set fire to it, and the loss was almost incalculable. Fang Hung-chien also enlarged the old house in the occupied hometown several times. The beauty is that the house will expand without invading the neighboring land. Zhao Xinmei, who lives in the Concession, can't do house tricks.",

The beauty is that the house will expand without invading the neighboring land. Zhao Xinmei, who lives in the Concession, can't do house tricks. He is confident in his good looks. He doesn't have to worry about how many women used to take a fancy to him. He just said that if the war didn't happen and the office didn't retreat through negotiations, his official could still do it-no, do it. Wang Chuhou's ostentation and extravagance before the war may not be as lavish as he said, but his colleagues believe his boasting, because his living and eating are indeed more comfortable than others, and everyone knows that he is a dismissed corrupt official-\"It is rare for the government not to cover up like this, but he has already made enough!\" Pointing to the calligraphy and painting of contemporary celebrities hanging on the wall, he said, \"Many of these were given by my friends after I fled. I am disheartened. I no longer buy antiques, and I can't buy anything in the mainland-those two were painted by my wife. \" The two men stood up and looked closely at the two small straight landscapes. Fang Hung-chien said that he didn't know that Mrs.Wang could draw, because of an accident. Zhao Xinmei said that she had heard for a long time that Mrs.Wang was good at painting, and her name was true. These two expressions are opposite and complementary. Mr.Wang touched his beard happily and said, \"My wife's health is unfortunately not good. She is interested in painting and music.\" Before she finished, Mrs.Wang came out. When the flesh and blood are stopped evenly, it is not thin, that is, there is no blood in the face, and there is no rouge, only powder. The lips are painted bright red, and the cheongsam is light purple, which makes the face brutally white. Long eyelashes, eyes tilted upward. I didn't perm my hair, but I combed it in a bun. I think it's because the local barber shop can't get a perm at home. Holding a leather hot water bottle in her hand, her ten nails are all red, which is certainly not the color she got when she painted, because she painted green landscapes.\r\nMrs.Wang said that she wanted to invite two people over for a long time, but her health failed to live up to expectations, which delayed her until now. They asked her if she was well, and said that she had never dared to visit, so the meal was exempted. Mrs.Wang said that she is healthier in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, and she must come to dinner. Mr.Wang said with a smile, \"I didn't invite this meal for nothing. The matchmaker made it to accept the thank-you instrument, and you have to add eighteen to eighteen-thirty-six tables to eat your thank-you wine!\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"How can I afford this? Xie Damei has no money first, let alone get married. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Who has spare money to get married these days? I can't take care of myself! Mr.and Mrs.Wang, thank you very much for dinner and matchmaking, okay? \"\r\nMr.Wang said, \"The world has changed! Why don't young people have any enthusiasm? Not at all-er-'romantic'? If you refuse to get married, you have to pretend to be poor! Ok, we don't want to thank the instrument, but work for you for nothing, Xian, don't we? \"\r\nMrs.Wang said, \"Oh! You two blow and sing. I don't know much about Mr.Fang, but you students studying abroad have inexhaustible property with you. We know all about Mr.Zhao's family background and future, but I'm afraid the lady can't climb it-see if I'm a matchmaker? \" Everyone laughed with her.\r\nHsin-mei said, \"Someone took a fancy to me.

Your newly returned single students are like freshly baked sesame cakes, which can't even be grabbed by a lady's family. Scare! I've seen a lot, and the richer young people are, the less willing they are to get married. They can be independent, don't care about their wives' dowry and their husbands' backers, and would rather have a girlfriend and spend a lot of time fooling around. Anyway, they are rich. If you don't have the money to get married, it's much more economical to marry a wife than to promiscuous girlfriends. Your excuses are not sufficient. \"\r\nThe two men were shocked and were about to answer when Wang Chuhou pretended to be serious and said, \"I have a statement. I didn't marry you for the sake of saving money. When I was young, I was a well-known disciplined person, and I never played around. What you said was misunderstood! \" As he spoke, he winked playfully at Hung-chien and Hsin-mei.\r\nMrs.Wang snorted contemptuously, \"When you were young? I-I don't believe you were young. \"\r\nWang Chuhou turned red. Hung-chien quickly said that Mr.and Mrs.Wang were so kind that they didn't dare to live up to it, but they wanted to know who they were introducing. Mrs.Wang clapped her hands and said, \"All right, all right! Mr Fang is willing. Who are these two young ladies? The secret must not be revealed. Thick, don't say it! \"\r\nMr.Wang and Mrs.Meng urged him so closely that he felt comfortable again, saying, \"You will know when you come tomorrow. Don't take it too seriously, so let's talk about it. If the two of you are boring, what does it have to do with eating a meal? The other party will never take this as a handle and sue in court, haha! I have a piece of advice. This war doesn't seem to last for a year or two, so it should be dragged on well. Waiting for peace before getting married, both of them have wasted their youth. Don't send the ritual later,' this is very reasonable. When you get married, it's good for both public and private. Our school has a bright future, but it's not easy to hire people at the moment. People like you-Xian, don't I often tell you about them? The school will never let you go if you are willing to come and bend. If you get married and start a family here, you will settle down, and you can't leave. The school has borrowed a lot. My brother-don't tell anyone-may be in charge of the Faculty of Arts next semester. The Department of Education will be separated from the Faculty of Arts and become a normal college. Now Mr.Kong, the head of the Department of Education, can't be the head of the Faculty of Arts. Brothers are willing to do everything possible to detain you for their own sake. And their families also work at school, and the couple have two incomes, so the burden of life does not increase-\"\r\nMrs.Wang cut him off and said, \"I'm so poor! It' s true that you just said' there is no romance at all', and what are you doing? \"\r\nMr.Wang said, \"Look at your impatience! Romance is coming soon. Marriage is the happiest thing in life. My wife and I are both lovers. If we are unhappy, we should persuade you not to get married. Will you still be a matchmaker?",

She and I-\"\r\nMrs.Wang frowned and waved her hand. \"Stop it, disgusting!\" She remembered visiting a temple in Chengdu last year and meeting a monk who talked about reincarnation. Her husband secretly said to himself, \"When I die, I'll throw myself in the body as soon as possible, so I can marry you for the second time.\" Suddenly, I felt disgusted. Hung-chien and Hsin-mei tried their best to compliment each other and said that the couple like them were one in a thousand.\r\nOn the way back to school, they discussed Mrs.Wang carefully. Everyone thinks she is somebody, but why marry a husband who is twenty years older than her? The two men arbitrarily thought that her family was poor, and they envied Wang Chuhou as a local official. Her paintings are passable, but the words on them look like those written by Lao Wang. Hung-chien pretended to be an expert and said, \"What you can't trace when you write is no more changeable than drawing. Many women can draw a few freehand brushstrokes of landscapes, but writing kills them. Mrs.Wang's handwriting is afraid of making a fool of herself. \" Hung-chien reached the door of his bedroom and was taking out his key to unlock it. Suddenly, Hsin-mei stammered, \"Have you noticed that Mrs.Wang looks a little bit like Su Wenwan?\" Before he finished, he went upstairs in three steps. Hung-chien watched him in amazement.\r\nAfter the guests left, Mr.Wang and his wife went back to the bedroom and asked, \"I never said anything wrong today, did I?\" This is the usual question. After every social intercourse, Mrs.Wang, who likes to be picky, always corrects her husband. Mrs.Wang said, \"No, I'm not in the mood to remember-but why don't you tell them about the dean of literature! You always like to blow in front. \" Wang Chuhou did have some regrets at this time, but he insisted, \"That doesn't matter. Let them know that half of their jobs are in my hands. Why did you sweep my face today? \"Wang Chuhou remembered, and his anger flared up.\" It's just those words about being young or not, \"he added, because his wife's expression was surprised. Mrs.Wang was looking at the round mirror of the dresser, critically examining her appearance, and said, \"Oh, I see. Look at your face in the mirror. It looks like everyone can eat it. How terrible! I don't want to see you! \" Mrs.Wang didn't push away her husband standing behind her. She just took out the velvet racket from the powder box and slapped Mr.Wang's livid face twice in the mirror, blurring his face.\r\nLiu Dongfang has been on her mind these days. Both father and mother are dead, and my sister's life is my brother's responsibility. Last year in Kunming, someone kindly introduced her, but nothing came of it. Of course, with her at home, Mrs.Liu has many helpers. For example, she tied all the woolen clothes on her two children, and her eldest daughter slept with her. But as the years go by, my brother and sister-in-law are afraid that she won't get married, which will be a burden for life. She fled to the mainland the year before last, so she should enter the fourth grade of university. The fourth-grade students are not allowed to transfer, and the sister-in-law has to have children.

For this matter, Liu Dongfang was very sorry, so she had to laugh at it, saying that there are not many women who graduated from college, and several of them can really make a living on their own. Mrs.Liu blames her husband for teaching her sister to enter a women's university in the first place. If she had entered a school for boys and girls, the marriage would have been settled long ago. Liu Dongfang was in a hurry and said, \"Miss Fan graduated from the school of boys and girls. Why didn't she marry?\" Mrs.Liu said, \"There you go again. She's much better than Miss Fan.\" She's a good sister-in-law if she says that about the girl. Liu Dongfang sighed, \"It may be predestined. My mother always said that when my sister was born, her face was down and her back was up, and she was going to die at her mother's house. When my sister was young, we often played jokes on her. Now it seems that she really wants to be an old maid. \" Mrs.Liu said quickly, \"How can you be an old maid? I'm really old. It's good to marry someone to fill the house. Isn't it nice to be like Mrs.Wang? \" There is a great intention to save destiny by manpower. Last year, Liu Dongfang helped Fang Hung-chien to settle disputes. Suddenly, it occurred to him that it was not bad for this man to be a brother-in-law: he was a man who saved himself, so he should be grateful for his kindness and marry himself, and his position could be consolidated; Such a good opportunity must be missed, unless this person is a standard fool. Mrs.Liu also praised her husband's quick mind, but she was only worried that Fang Hung-chien's skills were too bad and asked her brother-in-law to hold on to his job for him. Later, when she heard from her husband that this man was clever, she was relieved. She planned to get married in the future, and the new couple would live in their own house. Anyway, there was an empty room, but a lease had to be formally established, otherwise the family would take away the luck and cleverness of the Liu children if they raised children. When Mrs.Wang agreed to be a matchmaker, the couple were so happy that they revealed the news to Miss Liu, expecting that she would be shy and happy. Who knows that she only blushed and said nothing. Mrs.Liu was quick-witted and said, \"Have you seen this Fang? Your brother said it was better than Kunming-\"Her husband was so anxious that he kicked her leg under the table. Miss Liu spoke, saying a lot. First of all: she doesn't want to marry. Who taught Mrs.Wang to be a matchmaker? Besides: women are so cheap! What \"matchmaking\" and \"introduction\" are so nice! Isn't it just like selling chickens and ducks in the market, dressing up for men to choose? Not to their liking, after a meal, there is nothing below, what a shame! She also said: she didn't eat her sister-in-law for nothing. What she did at home was worth a servant. Why did she have to be kicked out? The more I talk about it, the more angry I get, and even the fact that I didn't graduate from college is brought out. Afterwards, Mr.Liu blamed his wife for not mentioning the matchmaking in Kunming, which touched her stomach. Mrs.Liu said angrily, \"Your Liu family's dead temper! Whoever marries her is also unlucky! \"",

Afterwards, Mr.Liu blamed his wife for not mentioning the matchmaking in Kunming, which touched her stomach. Mrs.Liu said angrily, \"Your Liu family's dead temper! Whoever marries her is also unlucky! \" Tomorrow morning, the older girl who slept with Miss Liu came to report to her parents that her aunt had been crying for half a night. Miss Liu didn't have breakfast and lunch that day, and she walked around the river behind the house alone. Mr.and Mrs.Liu were frightened, thinking that she was dying. Even if it didn't kill her, it was not good for the whole school to know, and she was busy sending big girls to follow her. Fortunately, she came back from dinner and ate two bowls. This matter will never be mentioned again. Wang's post came, and she kept silent. Elder brother and sister-in-law also dare not explore her tone; In private, on the morning of dinner, there was no movement, so I went to ask Mrs.Wang to persuade me to drive. That morning, Miss Liu asked the old lady to prepare a charcoal iron and said that she would iron clothes. Brother and sister-in-law snickered at each other.\r\nMiss Fan found that there was a secret in her heart, and it was as itchy as a cough in her throat. It is vanity of human nature for important people to know that they have a secret, but not to let others know what it is. When they ask and ask them to guess. Miss Fan lacks such a whispering interrogator. She and Miss Sun share the same room, and as usual, they won't get along well. She lives in a big room by herself and gives Miss Sun half of it for free. If miss sun is beautiful and rich, maybe she can be forgiven, but she is just such an ordinary girl. If you are from Shanghai, you can't see anything more fashionable than yourself except that the cheongsam is shorter. Therefore, although they often go shopping together, they don't confide. Since Mrs.Wang said that she would introduce Zhao Xinmei to her, she has become even more wary of Miss Sun, because Miss Sun often says that she will visit Hsin-mei in the professor's dormitory. Of course, Miss Sun told me that Hsin-mei had always been called \"Uncle Zhao\", but nowadays girls can easily forget the distinction between seniority and inferiority. Wang Jialai's post, she kept it a secret. She usually has a hobby, and likes watching plays, especially tragedies. There are no plays in the local theaters here, so she tries to buy famous plays by modern domestic playwrights and read them carefully. The sentence in the dialogue is like: \"We should be brave! Brave! Brave! \" \"Live happily and die simply!\" \"The night is so deep, can the light be far away?\" She hit the heavy bar with a red pencil beside her, silently reciting or reciting, as if the mystery of life had been solved. Only when you are unhappy, such as the good moon arouses a sense of life experience, or performs the duty of \"girl guidance\", and the girl is not guided, muttering: \"If you are a college graduate, why should you be qualified to guide us?\" I have to take care of the old lady and hand out toilet paper in the toilet! \" -at this time, she found that these philosophical epigrams were of no help. Living is not happy, but dying is not easy; The night seems deep enough, but the light is still invisible. Most of the love in tragedy is lofty romance, and she also feels that there must be great spiritual twists and turns before marriage. There is one thing, she will never get off. She heard that the more women's love experience, the greater the magic they have on men; I also heard that men are only willing to marry a woman with a pure heart. If Zhao Xinmei courted, where would she go from here to here?",
        "e7d57637-53e0-4078-aa8b-b3a2524dbccb": "I have to take care of the old lady and hand out toilet paper in the toilet! \" -at this time, she found that these philosophical epigrams were of no help. Living is not happy, but dying is not easy; The night seems deep enough, but the light is still invisible. Most of the love in tragedy is lofty romance, and she also feels that there must be great spiritual twists and turns before marriage. There is one thing, she will never get off. She heard that the more women's love experience, the greater the magic they have on men; I also heard that men are only willing to marry a woman with a pure heart. If Zhao Xinmei courted, where would she go from here to here? The day before the treat, she was so blessed that she came up with a balanced attitude, indicating that many people loved themselves madly, but they never loved anyone, so this time it was the first love. It happened that she went shopping that day, and the female shopkeeper in the store asked her, \"Miss, are you studying at school?\" This question lightened her psychological burden of age. At the age of six or seven, she was so happy that she walked like a spring in the arch of her foot. When I went back to school and told this to Miss Sun, Miss Sun said, \"I will ask the same question. You are like a student.\" Miss Fan called her dishonest.\r\nMiss Fan is a little nearsighted. She doesn't know the famous American saying-\r\n\u3000\u3000Men never make passes\r\nAt girls wearing glasses-[1] But she doesn't wear glasses. When I was a student, I had to wear glasses to copy the blackboard in class. Because all the male students she knows are not enough to borrow notes to copy. Female students with the help of boys will never easily lend this kind of genuine or full-length notes for making concerted efforts and updating; As for the female students who don't have the help of boys, hum! Although Miss Fan is a woman herself, her ability to record the same sex is not too high. Like all women who are eager to learn and love beauty, she wears rimless glasses with platinum feet; Endless glasses seem to be irrelevant, and how much they melt into one with their faces. They are not worn when they are worn, and their boundaries are clear. As soon as they are worn, they hang up the signboard of female pedants. This pair of glasses is only necessary for her to use when she is watching a play. In addition, like going to a grand event today: not only do you need it for combing your hair and makeup, but you can observe it carefully; After dressing up, I need it more when I put on my clothes and look at my \"overview\" in front of a half-dressed mirror. She thinks her eyes are dull, which is because she was too excited to sleep well last night. Mrs.Wang has ointment for applying eyelashes, so she might as well borrow it early to set off a dreamy expression in her eyes. You can also ask her to criticize and correct your clothes as soon as possible-Miss Fan is a \"girl guide\" and she regards Mrs.Wang as a \"girl guide\". She arrived at Wang's house just after five o'clock, saying that coming earlier could help. Mr.Wang said that there were not many guests today, and the food was ordered from the first restaurant in town. He didn't need help, and lamented that the good cook at home had fled to death. Now the food cooked by people can't be treated. Mrs.Wang said, \"You believe her! She didn't come here to help. She came here today to show off her skills and let Zhao Xinmei know that she is not only good at learning and looks, but also a housekeeper. \" Miss Fan forbade her to talk nonsense and asked her to criticize herself in a low voice. Mrs.Wang also thought that she didn't wear enough red, and said that she should add some joy, take her to the room and paint rouge for her. As a result, the color Miss Fan painted at the banquet today was as red as the color American Indians painted on the battlefield. She also asked Mrs.Wang to borrow mascara, and declared that she was not suffering from eye tuberculosis and there was no danger of infection. Wang Chuhou only heard laughter outside; It's really \"where there are chickens and ducks, there is a lot of dung;\" Where there are young women, laugh more. \"\r\nMiss Liu was the last to arrive. Frank and amiable face, plump body, tight clothes, wrinkles on clothes when you move."
