On the contrary, Mrs.Wang is very talkative and asks questions of Miss Liu. Wang Chuhou went inside for a while, then came out and said to his wife, \"I have made a patrol.\" Hung-chien asked him what he was looking for. Mr.Wang said with a smile, \"It's a joke. I use two female servants. This girl, I used it as soon as I came, for more than half a year. In addition, an old maid changed it several times and was still not satisfied. The first one used to ask for leave every day to go home for the night. After dinner, I couldn't find her shadow, and my rice bowls were piled up without washing. I wonder how this works. I changed it. It's very quiet. I've been here for more than ten days and I haven't been home. My wife and I are happy, ha, one night, in the middle of the night, the door was knocked down. This woman used to have a concubine, who often sneaked into my place for trysts, so she didn't go back. When her husband got wind of it, he came to catch the rape, which made me angry to death. Finally, I changed this one now, and she is still smart. It is ok to teach her to cook a few coarse dishes. Sometimes the amount of food she cooks seems to be too small. I think maybe she deducted money for buying food. People are greedy for small profits; Don't be stupid or deaf, don't be an old man', forget it. It's also troublesome to change people frequently! After lecturing her with my wife. On one occasion, President Gao's friend brought him thirty sparrows all the way, and the principal asked me to cook them for him. He came to have dinner-you know, the principal likes to come to the shed for dinner. My wife said that the sparrows had no taste when fried. According to her hometown's method, she stuffed minced meat in the sparrows' stomachs and braised them in brown sauce. There were few people at dinner that night, President Gao, my wife and I, and Mr.Wang from the Department of Mathematics-he was very interesting. Mr.Gao and Mr.Wang all say that this is the best way to burn sparrows. After eating, Mr.Wang suddenly asked if there were thirty sparrows. We thought he didn't eat enough, but he saidno. According to his calculation, everyone only ate twenty-Xian, twenty? -twenty-five, there should be five left. I said, \"Did I miss my hand?\" President Gao also said it was outrageous. My wife went to the kitchen to ask questions, and sure enough she saw half a bowl of juice, four-not five-sparrows! You know what mom says? She said she would stay and give me something to eat next morning. We were angry and laughing. No one will eat these four extra sparrows-\"\r\n\"What a pity! Why not give it to me! \" Hsin-mei, like a suffocating person, suddenly rushed out of the gas, took a breath of fresh air and interjected this sentence.\r\nMrs.Wang said with a smile, \"Who told you not to come then? The result was given to President Gao. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"In this way, you female servant is a fool and loyal. Although you are not careful, you have a good heart.\"\r\nMr.Wang caressed his moustache and laughed on his back. Mrs.Wang said, \"Stupid loyalty? She is not stupid and unfaithful! We were taken in by her from the beginning. Recently, the chicken soup served was as light as boiled water. I said to Mr.Wang,' This is not the soup in which the chicken was boiled, just like the chicken had bathed in it once.' He misheard me, thinking that I said,' The chicken washed its feet in this water', and joked with me about' I'll spare you for being as sly as a ghost and drinking the water for washing your feet'-\"Everyone laughed, and Mr.Wang readily appreciated his quip-\"I asked her to ask, but she refused. Later, I coaxed and frightened this girl, and I figured it out. This old lady has a son. Whenever I treat her here, she calls him and hides the good ones in the rice room for him to eat.",

I asked this girl why she didn't tell me earlier, and she was also involved in stealing her mouth. She refused to say, and it was only when she arrived that it was revealed that the old lady wanted her to be a daughter-in-law and was allowed to give her her son. Do you think it's good or not? So every time we treat you, let's inspect the house first. I don't think these two can be used anymore. I will replace them when I have the opportunity. \"\r\nGuests speak at the same time. Hsin-mei and Hung-chien said, \"Employing people is really a problem.\" Miss Fan said, \"I'm scared to death. Fortunately, I'm alone, so I don't need anyone.\" Miss Liu said, \"The old maid in our family often makes trouble.\"\r\nMrs.Wang smiled at Miss Fan and said, \"You are not alone soon-Miss Liu, your brother and sister-in-law really owe you.\"\r\nThe servant served the food and everyone scrambled to sit down. The host said that the round table is neck and neck, but it can't be chaotic. I also advise everyone to eat more vegetables, because there are few dishes. Of course, the guests said that the food was too abundant, and there were only a few people, fearing that they could not eat much. Mr.Wang said, \"Hey, I forgot to call Miss Sun, Miss Fan's roommate, today. She has never been here.\" Miss Fan squinted at Hsin-mei beside her. When Hung-chien heard about Miss Sun, his heart jumped, his face burned and he felt ridiculous. What does Miss Sun have to do with himself? Mrs.Wang said, \"At first, Mr.Zhao brought such a young lady. We all guessed that it was Mr.Zhao's lover, but later we realized that it was irrelevant.\" Hsin-mei smiled at Hung-chien and said, \"Look how terrible the rumors are!\" Miss Fan said, \"Miss Sun has a lover now-this is not a rumor. I share a room with her and know it very well.\" When Hsin-mei asked who, Hung-chien assumed that he would talk about himself and tried to be calm. Miss Fan said, \"I can't reveal her secret.\" Hung-chien ate vegetables desperately in panic to prevent his facial muscles from calming down and having a correct expression. Hsin-mei glanced at Hung-chien and smiled and said, \"Maybe I know who it is. You don't have to tell me.\" With a mouthful of food in his mouth, Hung-chien ventured to say, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" Miss Fan misunderstood Hsin-mei's smile and said with peace of mind, \"You know, too? The news is so well informed! Lu Zixiao's pursuit of her is still in this winter vacation. It is very good to correspond every day. How did you know when you were in Guilin? \"\r\nHung-chien's emotion is like a whirlpool. You can rest assured that you didn't get it yourself. But it hurts to hear that Miss Sun is good with others. I am not in love with Miss Sun. Why don't I want her to be better with Lu Zixiao? Miss Sun has her cuteness, but her charm is not stable, and she is barely charming, which is not true beauty. Of course, his temper is pleasing-it's all Hsin-mei's fault, and his jokes have taken root in his heart. A person like Lu Zixiao will never take a fancy to her. But Miss Fan said that they corresponded every day and would never lie out of thin air. Suddenly lost interest.\r\nMr.and Mrs.Wang and Miss Liu were all surprised.",

Of course, his temper is pleasing-it's all Hsin-mei's fault, and his jokes have taken root in his heart. A person like Lu Zixiao will never take a fancy to her. But Miss Fan said that they corresponded every day and would never lie out of thin air. Suddenly lost interest.\r\nMr.and Mrs.Wang and Miss Liu were all surprised. Hsin-mei took the attitude of a great politician listening to information, as if he had known it beforehand, and replied calmly, \"I have my report. Lu Zixiao once asked Mr.Fang to introduce Miss Sun to him, but I don't agree. Zi Xiao is too old-\"\r\nMrs.Wang said, \"Mind your own business. You're not her real' uncle', but so what-if I had known that, we didn't invite them to come today. However, Zi Xiao is a little impish, and I don't like it very much. \"\r\nMr.Wang shook his head and said, \"That won't do. People in the history department should have less contact. Zi Xiao is a pillar professor in the history department, but he is certainly not a kid. But he's worse than a kid. He's a villain, haha! He likes to gossip. Han Xueyu has learned a lot. If you invite his men to dinner instead of him, he suspects that you have a plot to collude with others. There have been a lot of \"Cantonese School\", \"Young Generation School\" and \"School of Studying in Japan\" in the school. Mr.Zhao, Mr.Fang, aren't you afraid that people will call you \"Wang Pai\" when you eat here? Miss Liu's brother has been called' Wang Pai'. \"\r\nHsin-mei said, \"I know that there are several small organizations among my colleagues, and they often have dinners. Neither I nor Hung-chien will attend, so they can arrange whatever we want.\"\r\nMr.Wang said, \"You are followers of President Gao's clique-relatives or proteges of Mr.Gao. Of course, Mr.Fang and Mr.Gao didn't know each other before, but because of Mr.Zhao's indirect relationship, it's a dragonfly on the periphery of the Dragon School or on the dragon, hehe! Mr.Fang, I'm joking with you-I know it's all catching shadows, otherwise I would never dare to invite you to my room. \"\r\nMiss Fan has no interest in school factions, but only feels obligated to attack Miss Sun: \"It's really boring to have political parties in school. Miss Sun is a nice person, but she is too untidy. Her things are all over the room-oh, Mr.Zhao, I'm sorry, I forgot that she is your niece. \"She smiled with shame.\r\nHsin-mei said, \"What does that matter? But, Hung-chien, we didn't think she was sloppy when we came the same way. \"\r\nHung-chien was surprised and angry because people said he was from the periphery of the Dragon Sect. He asked Hsin-mei and casually said \"Yes\". Mrs.Wang said, \"I heard that Mr.Fang is very talkative. Why don't you talk today?\" Fang Hung-chien said quickly that the food was so good that he even swallowed his tongue.\r\nHalfway through the meal, I talked about not being able to entertain myself. Mrs.Wang said that she had a deck of cards, but her home was close to school-Mr.Wang didn't let her finish, but he interrupted, \"My wife is nervous and playing cards is too noisy, so she doesn't play-who will come at this time?\"\r\n\"Ah, Mrs.Wang, why don't you treat me? Mr.Wang, I found it by smelling the fragrance, \"Gao Songnian said all the way in.\r\nEveryone stood up in awe and greeted each other, except Mrs.Wang, who was lazily supporting the back of the chair, and sat up and said, \"Have you had dinner? Also to eat a little, \"a wall called choose and employ persons to add chairs and chopsticks.",

President Gao made a virtual concession and sat down calmly. He was picking up chopsticks, rolling his eyes around the table and shouting, \"This seat is not possible! Your seats are interesting, I'm so confused! Why have you two been separated? Hsin-mei, come and sit down. \" Hsin-mei refused. President Gao asked Miss Fan, who just laughed and stuck to the chair like a candy. The headmaster couldn't help but say, \"OK, OK! The general trend of the world, together for a long time, will be divided, divided for a long time, \"ha ha laugh, and compliment Miss Fan beautiful, drink a mouthful of wine, smooth yellow face shiny like polished yellow shoes.\r\nHung-chien was unhappy with Kao Sung's old age because of the associate professor, so he had little contact. I didn't expect him to be so approachable. Gao Songnian studied biology and knew that \"the survival of the fittest\" was a matter of course. His conceit can best adapt to the environment, and what to say to whom and on what occasions. In the old novels, the \"200,000 imperial coach\" was mentioned, and he always said that he was \"eighteen martial arts, and everything was fine\"; Gao Songnian, as the principal, knows everything about the knowledge of the three hospitals and ten departments in the school-this \"pass\" is like the \"pass\" of \"smooth train\" and \"smooth stomach\". A few cosmetic words go in from the ear to the mouth, and don't stay in my mind at all. Today, the Political Institute holds its inaugural meeting, and I respectfully invite him to give a speech. He will talk about international relations and compare fascism with communism. In the final analysis, China's current political system is the best. The Literature Research Association will hold a get-together tomorrow. In addition to saying that poetry is \"the soul of a nation\" and literature is \"a tool for psychological construction\", he will also encourage you to be \"Tagore of India, Shakespeare of Britain, Russell of France-er-France (sounds like\" Lu Su \"again, meaning Rousseau), Goethe of Germany, and American- At the orientation meeting of the Physics Society the day after tomorrow, he didn't have an atomic bomb to talk about at that time, but he could only call out a few theories of relativity, which made Einstein's right ear across the ocean have a fever and even sneeze. In addition, he will chat with military instructors and say one or two \"damn it!\" The instructor was so surprised that he took a seat at the table and led him to be a fellow. Today, a few acquaintances have a casual meal, and there is a woman. Of course, he is arrogant and has another adaptation. Mrs.Wang said, \"We are blaming you. Why do you choose this terrible place for running a school? Everyone is bored to death.\"\r\n\"I can't afford to be suffocated! I can barely pay for others' lives. Mrs.Wang's life is so precious that I can't afford it. Mr Wang, isn't it? \" The boss is so humorous that everyone does their duty, and there are two or one smiles.\r\nZhao Xinmei said, \"I wish I had a radio.\" Miss Fan also said that she likes listening to the radio.\r\nWang Chu said kindly, \"It's good to be a poor place.

Here's to everyone.\r\nHung-chien said, \"Mrs.Wang said just now that playing cards was a pastime-\"\r\nThe headmaster said flatly, \"Who plays cards?\"\r\nMrs.Wang said, \"Didn't Mr.Wang borrow our deck of cards to play every day?\" Regardless of Gao Songnian's warning glances.\r\nHung-chien said, \"Anyway, Hsin-mei and I are not interested in mahjong tiles. I wanted to buy a deck of cards to play bridge[3], but I searched all over town and bought a chess set. When Hsin-mei lost, he struck the chess pieces on the table. The pieces made of wood couldn't stand his strength and broke several pieces, so he couldn't play chess these two days. \" Miss Fan smiled at Hsin-mei through President Gao, saying that she didn't expect him to be so childish. Miss Liu asked Hsin-mei to tell him about Hung-chien's loss of chess. President Gao said, \"It's good to play chess. Fortunately, I didn't buy cards. They are always a kind of gambling tools. Although there is no sound, it is not good for students to know. Li Meiting forbids students to play cards, and according to the principle of teachers and students living together-\"\r\nHung-chien wondered how Kao Sung-nien, who had been like a person for less than a few minutes, had become the principal again. He wished he could say, \"Let the Wangs' mahjong be made public and invite the students to gamble. This is living together.\" Mrs.Wang interrupted President Gao impatiently and said, \"I have a headache when I hear the word' live together'. It's all Li Meiting's tricks. Anyway, his own family is not here, and it's people with families who suffer. I really didn't play cards because I was afraid of making trouble, but now I have to play. I can do it if you want, headmaster. It's not Li Mei-ting's turn to take charge. \"\r\nWhen President Gao saw that Mrs.Wang had asked her to handle her by herself, he was full of affection and coquetry, and his heart trembled and he said, \"What a joke! However, it is difficult to run a school-just ask Mr.Wang-colleagues should be patient and peaceful. \"\r\nMrs.Wang sneered, \"I'm not Li Meiting's colleague. Principal, when did you hire me to your school-as a big momma? You are not qualified to be a teacher-\"Kao Sung-nien's voice was soothing in his throat-\"Today, Wednesday and Saturday night, I will come back and play it all night to see what Li Mei-ting does. Mr.Zhao and Mr.Fang, do you have the courage to come? \"\r\nGao Songnian sighed and said, \"I didn't say anything. Mrs.Wang, since you are here, I can only tell you. I broke into the table today as an unexpected guest. I came to discuss with Mr.Wang just because of Li Meiting. I didn't know you were treating me. \"\r\nThe guests all said, \"The headmaster is good, so please don't come.\" Mr.Wang asked calmly, \"What's the matter with Li Meiting?\" Mrs.Wang looked tired and didn't want to hear it.\r\nThe headmaster said, \"As soon as I got out of the office, he came and asked me who I would like to speak with next Monday's memorial week.

He said that if after he spoke, the students asked him if gambling at cards like Mr.Wang's was legitimate entertainment, how should he answer-\"Everyone suddenly said\" Oh \"-\"Of course, I covered for you and said that there would be no such thing. He said,' My colleagues know all about it, but only your headmaster'-\"Nonsense!\" Hsin-mei and Hung-chien said.

For several seconds, the room was quiet enough to hear ants crawling underground-but there were no ants at that time.\r\nThe headmaster smiled unnaturally and went on to say, \"There are jokes, Mrs.Wang. You will laugh when you hear them. He didn't know where he heard it, saying that your deck was made of American goods and rubber, and there was no sound when playing-\"burst into laughter, relieving the tension of the other person. Hung-chien asked Mrs.Wang if she was really silent. Mrs.Wang laughed at him as a countryman like Li Meiting, and said, \"How did blind Li become deaf? Where can there be American silent mahjong!\" President Gao was not impressed by this frivolity. He closed his mouth and didn't laugh, chatting in opposition.\r\nMr.Wang said, \"What does he want to do? Announce to the students? \"\r\nMrs.Wang said, \"Let's get to the bottom of it. Let's play cards aboveboard to avoid sneaking around. Cover the table with a blanket and cover the blanket with lacquer cloth.\" Miss Fan wisely commented, \"This is silent mahjong!\" -\"I'm tired of staying here. Let Li Meiting make trouble, the students will kick you out, and President Gao will suspend you and leave this place.\" The headmaster repeatedly tut! tut\uff01 tut\uff01\r\nMr.Wang said, \"He's just trying to be the head of the China Literature Department, and he's giving me a hard time. I really don't want to be this errand. I resigned from the headmaster several times, Mr.Gao, didn't I? However, my resignation is automatic. If anyone wants to force me to leave, that won't do. I won't leave. Li Meiting, he misjudged the wrong person. What he did, huh! I also know, for example, whoring in the town. \"\r\nMr.Wang stopped dramatically, and the others cried out in surprise. Hsin-mei and Hung-chien immediately thought of Wang Meiyu. President Gao paused and said, \"That won't be enough?\" Seeing that the headmaster was so partial, Hung-chien couldn't hold back his anger and said, \"I think what Mr.Wang said is very likely. Mr.Li came with us and made many jokes. If you don't believe me, just ask Hsin-mei.\" The headmaster's face was full of disapproval, saying, \"A gentleman conceals evil and promotes good.

However, Mr.Wang needn't dispute with him. I can persuade him later. \"\r\nMrs.Wang said magnanimously, \"All in all, it's my fault. Chu Hou really wanted to perfunctory him. I hated his face and never invited him to our place. Unlike Han Xueyu and his foreign wife, we don't treat the teachers and students of the history department with a small banquet on three days and a big banquet on five days; And it's wonderful, inviting students to dinner and colleagues to just have tea-\"Hung-chien remembered the history student who had diarrhea four or five times a night-\"It's a trivial matter to spend money, so I don't have the spirit, and I'm not as capable as that foreign lady. I'm a foreigner, so I have time for communication, entertainment and contact, and I can sing. We are China's country mothers-in-law, so let's settle down and stop making a fool of ourselves.

Wang Chuhou knew that Mrs.Wang was not talking about herself, but she was feverish all over-\"Mr.Gao doesn't have to persuade Li Meiting, and Chuhou doesn't have to fight with him.

When it was taken seriously by the headmaster, she said mysteriously, \"I know.\" Mr.Wang also touched his beard and repeatedly quoted Su Dongpo's famous saying: \"Take it for granted, take it for granted!\" Zhao Xinmei's eyes were glued to Mrs.Wang's face. Miss Liu was left out in the cold, full of anger, hating Mrs.Wang, her brother and sister-in-law, despising Miss Fan, regretting her coming today, and being taken in again. Suddenly she saw Hsin-mei's expression and glanced at Miss Fan with a sneer, making her feel better. Miss Fan also noticed, awakened Hsin-mei and said, \"Mr.Zhao, Mrs.Wang is really interested!\" Hsin-mei blushed and murmured, \"That's really interesting!\" Keep your eyes away from Miss Fan. Hung-chien said, \"This method is very good. However, Li Meiting is greedy for small profits and can only let him win; He will make trouble if he loses. \" The deskmate all laughed.

Mrs.Wang asked the female guest, \"Do you want to wash your hands in my room?\" The two ladies went with her. Gao Songnian and Wang Chuhou talked in a low voice. Hsin-mei said to Hung-chien, \"Let's go together later. Remember that.\" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Maybe I'd like to send Miss Liu home alone?\" Hsin-mei said seriously, \"Anyway, let me accompany you to see her off this time-isn't Mrs.Wang joking with us?\" Hung-chien said, \"Actually, no one needs to see anyone off. We'll go our way and they'll go theirs.\" Hsin-mei said, \"This can't be done.

Hsin-mei quickly stood up and said, \"Hung-chien, it's time for us to go, too, and take the two young ladies home by the way.\" Miss Liu said that she would go back alone and didn't need to be seen off. Hsin-mei repeatedly said, \"No, no, no! Send Miss Fan to the girls' dormitory first, and then send you home. I haven't been to your house yet. \" Hung-chien sniggered that Hsin-mei wanted to put aside Miss Fan, so he made out with Miss Liu, which would not cause another misunderstanding. Mrs.Wang was biting Miss Fan's ear, and Miss Fan pushed her away with a smile and anger. Mr.Wang said, \"All right, all right. No matter whether you go out, you are responsible for the safety of the two young ladies. \" President Gao said that he would sit for a while, and he was very envious: because the weather is so good, it is spring night who is walking, and the four of them are young, and they are good companions for walking in spring night.\r\nFour people walk side by side, with Fan Liu in the middle and Zhao Fang on each side. Approaching Banqiao, Miss Fan said that this bridge only allows two people to walk, and she would like to walk along the bottom of the river. When Hung-chien and Miss Liu reached the bridge, they suddenly heard Miss Fan scream, \"Oh, dear!\" Busy to stop, ask what's going on. Miss Fan smiled again, and Hsin-mei condemned her and advised her to walk on the bridge. The stones at the bottom of the river were slippery. Only then did I know that Miss Fan had a close fall, but Hsin-mei held on. Miss Liu crossed the bridge early and waited impatiently for them. Hung-chien and Miss Fan also crossed the shore and politely asked if they had twisted their muscles. Miss Fan thanked him and said that there was no twist-a little twist-but it doesn't matter, it will be fine-but you can't walk fast, so please don't wait for Miss Liu. Miss Liu answered in her nose, and Hung-chien said that Miss Liu and herself were willing to walk slowly. After not walking more than ten steps, Miss Fan called out for the second time, \"Oh, dear!\" I don't know where the handbag is. Everyone asked her if she fell to the bottom of the stream when she wrestled. She said maybe. Hsin-mei said, \"No one will pick it up at this time.

She scolded herself for being confused and wanted to go back to get it. \"How dare you wait?\" she said. Go ahead, I have Mr.Zhao with me anyway-Mr.Zhao, you are going to scold me. \" When a woman goes out, she forgets things as usual, so going out once is actually equal to twice. Anna said, \"Oh, no! I forgot to bring my handkerchief! \" Having said this, Mary, who was traveling with her, also remembered that she didn't bring lipstick. Julia reminded them and said, \"I'm even more confused! No money-\"So the three of them laughed as if this was the funniest thing between heaven and earth, and went back to get handkerchiefs, lipsticks and money hand in hand. However, this forgotten infectious disease did not reach Miss Liu, and Zhao Xinmei was so anxious that she complained in her heart, \"Is today destined?\" Suddenly Hung-chien touched his head and asked, \"Hsin-mei, did I wear a hat today?\" Hsin-mei was stupefied and suddenly realized, \"It seems that you wore it, and I can't remember clearly-yes, you wore a hat, and I-I didn't wear it.\" Hung-chien said that Miss Fan was looking for a handbag, which reminded him of his hat. Since Miss Fan is inconvenient to walk, anyway, he will go back to Wang's house to get her hat and bring her handbag. \"I'm fast, you wait for me here,\" he said, and ran away in three steps. He came back with only a handbag in his hand and no hat on his head, saying, \"I didn't wear a hat, Hsin-mei, and I was taken in by you.\" Hsin-mei said angrily, \"Miss Liu and Miss Fan, look at this man. He is really unreasonable. I am confused, I wish I should take care of his hat! \" Grateful to hold Hung-chien's hand in the dark. Miss Liu's smile is short and harsh. Miss Fan's thanks to Hung-chien were inappropriately cold, and she didn't say much until the girls' dormitory.\r\nRegardless of Miss Liu's refusal, Hung-chien and Hsin-mei sent her home. Of course she invited them in to sit down. Her big niece, who slept with her, was still sitting at the dinner table, and would not go to bed until she came back. She yawned repeatedly and wiped her eyes with her fists in her hands. When the girl saw that her aunt had brought guests, she jumped in and shouted all the way, \"Dad! Mom! \" I woke up all my brothers who were only 100 days old. Liu Dongfang was busy coming out to entertain, and Mrs.Liu came out with the baby.

Hung-chien was asked by Mrs.Liu to help him, so he had to feel disgusted. Hsin-mei was particularly happy to get rid of Miss Fan. Seeing that the child's exposed thigh was still clean, he put his mouth together and kissed it, which made the Liu family laugh and thought that Mr.Zhao was really nice. Hung-chien was angry with him for saving face and asked him if he wanted a hug. Seeing that the child was uncomfortable being hugged by Hung-chien, Mrs.Liu thought that Hsin-mei's position was high and he was a stranger, so he couldn't desecrate him. She reached out and said, \"We are very heavy, and Uncle Fang is tired of hugging.\" Hung-chien returned the child, and when people were not looking, he took out his handkerchief to wipe the dried spit on his face. Hsin-mei said, \"That's a good boy. He's not afraid of being born.\" Mrs.Liu praised the child in a series of ways, such as how to be sensible, how to be good, and how to sleep till dawn. The child's eldest sister, with her eyes wide open and impatient, said, \"He cried, too, and woke me up at night.\" Miss Liu said, \"I wonder who will cry! Who grew up so big, grab something to eat, but beat the second brother, just cry straight, shame! \" The girl was in a hurry, pointing to Miss Liu and saying, \"My aunt is an adult, and she also cried.

The conversation in the future is just like using artificial respiration to save a drowning person, and it can't be saved. Miss Liu never showed her face again. After leaving the door, Hsin-mei said, \"The children are terrible. They can tell everything. Miss Liu is calm and happy on the surface. Who would have thought that she would cry? She really has her own sufferings, alas! \" Hung-chien said, \"You have nothing to do with Miss Fan. I promised Liu Dongfang help, but I have no intention of getting married here. Mrs.Wang is really carrying coals to Newcastle. Liu Dongfang will definitely misunderstand me for this matter in the future. \" Hsin-mei said lightly, \"That won't be enough.\" Then he asked Hung-chien his impression of Mrs.Wang and asked him to help him guess how old she was.\r\nIn Hung-chien's mind, the correspondence between Miss Sun and Lu Zixiao was like a rat biting something in the back wall, which disturbed the whole night and could not be driven out. He ventured to write to Miss Sun and advised her to be cautious in making friends as a friend. Finally, I convinced myself to let her go to be good with Lu Zixiao. I didn't fall in love with her. Why should I be jealous next door and mind other people's business? It's all Zhao Xinmei's fault. He made a joke so that he had a ghost in his heart, as if the hypnotist had been hinted at. Most of these things are jokes told by others. When it comes to the authorities who are seriously in love, they have seen a lot, and they will never be so stupid. Even so, I always feel that I have suffered a loss, and I hate Miss Sun and despise her. Unexpectedly, it was her who knocked at the door in the afternoon. When Hung-chien met her, his resentment in his heart vanished like a mist at sunrise.",

When Hung-chien met her, his resentment in his heart vanished like a mist at sunrise. She has been here several times, and she has never been able to make him as happy as this time. Hung-chien said that Guilin had not met since she came back, and asked her how she spent this winter vacation. She said that what Cheng Hung-chien and Hsin-mei brought back to Guilin had long wanted to thank them, but they had a fever twice. Today, they accompanied Miss Fan to deliver the book. Hung-chien asked with a smile whether to send the script to Hsin-mei, and Miss Sun replied with a smile. Hung-chien said, \"Did you go up and see Uncle Zhao?\"\r\nMiss Sun said, \"I'm not annoying! I never went upstairs. She will come to see Mr.Zhao and ask me what room he lives in upstairs and downstairs, and she doesn't want me to be a guide. I told her that I would never accompany her upstairs, and I came here on business. \"\r\n\"Hsin-mei may not thank you for being a guide.\"\r\n\"That's too difficult!\" Miss Sun's smile when she spoke showed that she didn't think it was difficult to be a human being-\"I didn't know that Mrs.Wang was treating me until she came back last night-\"This sentence was originally a common one, but she was too thoughtful, and she felt too far-fetched. She quickly pulled away and asked, \"Have you met this famous beauty, Mrs.Wang?\"\r\n\"What happened yesterday was that Wang and his wife were fooling around-they have seen it twice, and their manners are good. Is she a famous beauty? I heard this sentence for the first time today. \"\r\nWhen Hung-chien met her, it was unnatural. He kept fiddling with the Supernorma brand four-color pencil he brought back from Germany on his desk. Miss Sun wants to draw a pen, take out the red lead, draw a red mouth on the blank of the ink-absorbing cardboard, and draw ten sharp and long red dots about an inch apart, five in a group, representing nails, except for the face and body. When she finished painting, she said, \"This is Mrs.Wang's outline.\" After thinking about it, Hung-chien couldn't help laughing. \"It's a bit like it, thanks to your imagination!\"\r\nThe meaning of a sentence, in the listener's mind, often comes into the room like a strange cat, and there is no sound. After a while, you will realize its existence by meowing. Miss Sun initially said that she had something to come to the professor's dormitory, but Hung-chien didn't pay attention to it. At this time, this sentence woke up in his consciousness like sleeping. Maybe she came to see Lu Zixiao, and took a seat with her. A burst of jealousy in my heart, like chestnuts roasted on the fire, is so hot that it will burst its shell. Anxious to find out the truth, but afraid of leaving traces of concern for questioning, he said nonsense: \"Miss Fan is a wonderful person. I approached her for the first time yesterday. You are roommates, is it better? \"\r\n\"She only has eyes for Mrs.Wang, and now of course she has added Uncle Zhao-Mr.Fang, did you offend Miss Fan yesterday?\"\r\n\"I didn't. Why?\"\r\n\"She came back to scold you-alas, damn it! I moved my mouth. \"\r\n\"Strange thing! What did she scold me for? \"\r\nMiss Sun said with a smile, \"Nothing. She said that you don't say anything, people don't care, just eat. \"\r\nHung-chien blushed and said, \"Nonsense, that's not right. I also spoke, but I didn't say much.",

Yesterday, I simply went to make up the number. Without my share, of course, I just ate. \"\r\nMiss Sun took a quick look at him and said with a pencil, \"Miss Fan's words didn't count. She also called you a wood and said that you don't know whether you wear a hat or not. \"\r\nHung-chien laughed and said, \"I should scold! It's a long story. I'll tell it to you in the future. But this Miss Fan of yours-\"Miss Sun protested that Miss Fan is not hers-\"OK, OK. I don't think it's very good for your roommate to call names behind her back. If Hsin-mei really married her, all her old friends would be broken. She also mentioned you yesterday. \"\r\n\"She won't have a good word. What did she say? \"\r\nHung-chien hesitated, and Miss Sun said, \"I must know. Mr.Fang, you tell me, \"smile all accept, sweet stubborn.\r\nHung-chien once saw her look like this, and all her gentle protective feelings were aroused by her, saying, \"She didn't say much. She didn't scold you, and I can't remember clearly. It seems that someone wrote to you. That's a common thing, and she likes to make a fuss. \"\r\nMiss Sun's angry face made Hung-chien afraid to look at her. His face turned red like an explosion, and it fell like a spark on a pot of gasoline. She put the pencil on the table and said, \"Bastard! I hate it to death, and she is still promoting it for others! I have to settle accounts with her. \"\r\nHung-chien suddenly loosened the knot in his heart and said quickly, \"This is my fault. Don't pay attention to her. Let her make a rumor. No one will believe it anyway, so I won't believe it. \"\r\n\"It's really annoying, I can't think of a way to deal with it. That Lu Zixiao-\"Miss Sun hates these three words as if she wouldn't let them into her mouth-\"He suddenly wrote to me when he was near the big exam last year. I ignored him a word, and he came one letter after another. During the winter vacation, he came to see me in the girls' dormitory and insisted on inviting me out for dinner-\"Hung-chien asked nervously,\" You didn't go, did you? \" She bowed her head involuntarily-\"of course I won't go. He is really crazy, but the more he writes, the worse he becomes. The first letter said that it saved me the trouble of replying, and attached a piece of paper with a question written on it-\"Her face flushed again-\"Don't worry about this question. He said that if my answer to this question is-yes, write a plus sign in arithmetic and return the paper to him, otherwise write a minus sign. In a recent letter, he simply wrote all the addition and subtraction signs, and I just crossed out one. Look, isn't it angry and funny? \" As she spoke, her eyes smiled and her mouth pursed.\r\nHung-chien couldn't help laughing. \"This is really the gratitude of the professor-the professor wrote the letter. We took the course \"Common Sense\" in junior high school, and all the questions given by Mr.Wang were like this. But he is always sincere to you. \"\r\nMiss Sun stared blankly and said, \"Who wants him to be sincere to me? He can't write such a letter, and it makes me look ridiculous to others. \"\r\nHung-chien said wily, \"Miss Sun, I'll give you an idea. You didn't throw away the letters he gave you back and forth, did you?",
        "4324628d-4b98-45d0-b3ff-51700d651954": "In a recent letter, he simply wrote all the addition and subtraction signs, and I just crossed out one.

Don't write a word. \"\r\n\"Do you want to write his name on the outside of the package?\"\r\n\"Don't write either, of course he knows when he opens it-\"Psychoanalysts knew that the subconscious was up to something, and Hung-chien took revenge on others by returning Tang Xiaofu's letter to himself-\"You might as well tear up the letter and wrap it-no, don't, it's too embarrassing for him.\"\r\nMiss Sun said gratefully, \"I'll do as Mr.Fang says, and I can't go wrong. I really want to thank you. I don't know anything, and there is no one to discuss. I am afraid I have done something wrong. I don't know how to be a man. Being a man is so troublesome! Mr.Fang, will you teach me? \"\r\nThis is too much like an ignorant and poor little girl. Maybe it's true that Hsin-mei said she was playing dumb. Hung-chien's suspicion is like a swallow skimming through the water without stopping. Miss sun not only asked him for advice, but also obeyed him, which made him satisfied enough, and there was no room for suspicion in his heart. After a few more words, Miss Sun said that Hsin-mei was not going today, and she had to go back to the dormitory first to tell Hung-chien not to see him off. Hung-chien was afraid of showing off and didn't want to see her off, so he could only say, \"I'll see you off, and I'll see you off halfway to the school gate.\" Miss Sun stood staring at the floor and said, \"All right, but Mr.Fang is welcome. There is a lot of gossip outside-er-what a nuisance!\" Hung-chien jumped with fright and said, \"What gossip!\" After asking, I regret asking more questions. Miss Sun said, \"You-you didn't hear me, so don't worry about it. Goodbye, I will do as Mr.Fang taught me. \"Holding hands, I left with a smile. Hung-chien slumped in his chair, cold and hot as malaria. Think bad! Shit! I don't know what this gossip is. When two people are together, people will spread rumors, just as two branches are close, spiders will hang their nets. Today, I talked a lot and said a lot of things that I don't need to say and shouldn't say. Isn't this a \"gossip\"? Perhaps it was her own illusion. Miss Sun seemed to be very focused in her last words. She should be responsible for all her lifelong events, how can this be done! Hung-chien fidgeted with anxiety and turned around the room. If you don't love Miss Sun, why bother? Do you love her-a little?\r\nThere was a burst of women's laughter on the stairs, and pieces of glass houses that were brittle like flowers collapsed, interrupting Hung-chien's introspection. Followed by Hsin-mei's voice: \"Go well, don't fall over again like yesterday!\" There was another burst of women's laughter, and several rooms upstairs and downstairs suddenly opened and closed gently. Hung-chien thought that Miss Fan could really do it. These two bursts of laughter were tantamount to announcing to the whole school staff and students on the principal's bulletin board that she and Zhao Xinmei were lovers. Poor Hsin-mei! I don't know how to get angry Although Hung-chien felt sorry for Hsin-mei and relaxed at the same time, it seemed that the \"gossip\" about himself was reduced in severity. He was picking up a cigarette when Hsin-mei came into the room and grabbed it.",

He was picking up a cigarette when Hsin-mei came into the room and grabbed it. Hung-chien asked him, \"Didn't you send Miss Fan home?\" He ignored it, smoked a few mouthfuls, and shouted, \"Damn Sun Roujia, a little bastard [4], has an appointment with Lu Zixiao, why did she bring Fan Yi! When I meet her, I will scold her to death. \" Hung-chien said, \"Don't be blind and wrong. Do you remember? Didn't you say on the boat that borrowing books is the beginning of love between men and women? How is it now? Haha, the heavens are clear. \" Hsin-mei couldn't help laughing. \"Did I say that on the boat? Anyway, I don't want to see a word of the two plays she brought. \" Hung-chien asked who wrote the script. Hsin-mei said, \"If you want to read it, go and get it yourself. Two books are on my desk. Please open the window for me by the way. I am afraid of the cold, and I still have a charcoal basin today. As soon as she came in, the room smelled of her powder, and I couldn't stand it. I want to smoke, and she said she was afraid to smell the smoke. I opened all the windows. She sneezed at once, which scared me to close the window. I'm worried that if she doesn't catch cold, I won't be clean. \" Hung-chien smiled and said, \"I'm afraid of fainting, too. I won't go.\" He told the workmates to go up and open the window and bring the books down. The workmates moved all six or seven Chinese and western documents from Hsin-mei's desk just to be on the safe side, but they didn't miss those two plays. Open a book, the title page reads: \"To Yi-the author\", with a stamp under it. Hung-chien said, \"What an affectionate name!\" Turning to the title page of the second book, he shouted, \"Hsin-mei, have you seen this?\" Hsin-mei said, \"She told me not to read it then, and I don't want to read it now.\" As she said this, she reached for the book and saw only two lines in English:\r\n\u3000\u3000To my precious darling.\r\n\u3000\u3000From the author[5]\r\nHsin-mei snorted, closed the cover, looked at the author's name and asked Hung-chien, \"Do you know this man?\" Hung-chien said, \"I haven't heard of it. Maybe he is a famous writer. Are you going to fight him? \" Hsin-mei had air conditioning in his nose and said to himself, \"Ridiculous! Despicable! Hateful! \" Hung-chien said, \"Are you talking to me or scolding Fan Yi? She is really strange. Why did she show you the book that others wrote so many words? \" Hsin-mei's talk about American countryside came out again: \"You baby[6]! You really don't understand her intentions? \" Hung-chien said, \"Her intentions are so obvious that people suspect that she won't be so shallow.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Never mind her. All this happened to Mrs.Wang.' You have to tie the bell to solve the problem.' I'll go to see her tomorrow. \" Hung-chien said, \"Please make a statement for me, too.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Aren't you going?\" Hung-chien said, \"I'm not going. I think you are a little crazy about Mrs.Wang. I advise you to go less.",

I think you are a little crazy about Mrs.Wang. I advise you to go less. We people, locked in this valley, have a boring life, have no normal pastime, and our emotions are on the verge, so we should avoid stimulating it. \" Hsin-mei blushed and said, \"Don't talk nonsense. This is your own confession. Maybe you have a crush on someone. \" Hung-chien also gave him a central illness and stammered, \"You go, you go. Should Mrs.Wang give these two plays to Miss Fan?\" Hsin-mei said, \"That won't do. Give it back to her today. Sorry. She won't come tomorrow. She always wants me to visit her. Of course I won't. The afternoon after tomorrow, I sent the janitor to return it directly to her. \" Hung-chien thought it was a bad day today. This was the second person who returned something. He wrapped two books with a piece of paper and solemnly gave them to Hsin-mei: \"I sacrificed a piece of paper. There are famous handwriting on this book, so please be careful not to lose it. \" Hsin-mei said, \"Celebrity! There is no one of them who doesn't think he is famous. I'm afraid that a person's fame is too big to afford, and he has used several pseudonyms to divide it. I haven't done anything today, but I've had enough suffering. I should comfort myself. Let's go out for dinner, shall we? \" Hung-chien said, \"It's my turn to have dinner with the students today. However, it doesn't matter. You order at the restaurant first, and I'll perfunctory a bowl and come. \"\r\nHung-chien realized that he had mastered the class this semester and gradually got the method. Students also seem to have a better impression of him. The disciplinary punishment was given to the four students he disciplined, who occasionally came to chat and gave him a lot of inspiration. He found that he graduated a few years ago, but once he became a teacher, he belonged to the previous generation, and these students can no longer feel the same way. First, he doesn't have their interest. Second, he is more confident than they are. He only wonders that his colleagues who mix with young people don't feel the estrangement of the older generation. Do they feel it without showing it? Age is a fact that cannot be surpassed in the natural course, just like eat drink man woman, just like death. Sometimes, this sense of generation is more distinct than that of class. No matter how similar your political views, theories or interests are, people of all ages always draw a line for you, just like a crack in a porcelain, which is nothing at ordinary times. Once it is shaken, the crack first expands into a crack. Maybe I'm older than ten years, and I want to mix with young people to warm my decay with their anger, just like Mr.Lu Lao of the physics department, who takes part in all student activities, or like Wang Chuhou, who marries such a young wife. In any case, these students are pitifully blind on the one hand and horribly accurate on the other. Their praise may not be complete, but sometimes they are taken in by others; However, their abuse is absolutely fair, which is equal to the \"final judgment\" at the end of the world, and there is no room for appeal and retrial. Needless to say, they hated Li Meiting, and even Han Xueyu didn't really get their love.",

Needless to say, they hated Li Meiting, and even Han Xueyu didn't really get their love. As a gentleman, Hung-chien realized that ancient China people looked down on barbarians, modern westerners looked down on orientals, and bosses looked down on subordinates-no, subordinates looked down on their superiors, and none of them were as interested as when students looked down on their husbands. Their virtue is justice, not compassion. They refused to forgive, perhaps because they didn't need to be forgiven themselves, and they didn't know that they needed to be forgiven, so hung-chien thought.\r\nAs for the relationship between Hung-chien and his colleagues, it is only worse than last semester. Han Xueyu seemed to have twisted his neck and nodded reluctantly. Mrs.Han stared at the back of Hung-chien. Although Hung-chien didn't care, he always felt unhappy. Walking in the street, I have an extra scruple. When I see them coming from afar, I will avoid them. Lu Zixiao was so alienated from him that everyone understood it. What bothers him most is that Liu Dongfang seems to be a lot colder-Mrs.Wang is a good matchmaker! Wang Chuhou is very concerned about his affairs, which is his only comfort. He knows that Lao Wang is going to be the dean of literature, so he is a corporal. This kind of person with administrative ambitions is the most unreliable, and holding him on the stage may not be of much benefit to him; It seems that the foreign coachman has worked hard to pull the passenger to the hotel, still dragging the empty car to eat the west wind, and don't want to go in with him to eat. However, being an insignificant person, he has the qualification to be recruited by him, which shows that we should not underestimate ourselves. Lao Wang met him one day, laughing that the matchmaker's face had been swept away, and why none of the two marriages had been accomplished. Hung-chien could only say, \"If you don't appreciate it, you dare not climb high.\" Wang Chuhou said, \"You are a part-time student in the Foreign Languages Department, which is not interesting. I want to add a philosophy department next semester, so please take charge of the homework in the department. \" Hung-chien thanked him, \"Now I'm really homeless, and my colleagues and students look down on me.\" Wang Chu said kindly, \"What nonsense! But this matter, I am planning. Of course, your treatment should be adjusted. \" Unwilling to be too cultivated by him, Hung-chien said, \"The headmaster promised me that he would become a professor next semester.\" Wang Chu said kindly, \"It's a fine day today. Let's take a walk in the fields, shall we? Or talk to me in the shed and have a light meal. How about that? \" Of course, Hung-chien said that he was willing to walk with him.\r\nAfter crossing the stream and the Wangs' house, there were dozens of thin cypress trees, one of which fell down on the ground, and the two of them sat on the tree. Mr.Wang took out the cigarette in his mouth and pointed to the four directions like a pointer: \"This scenery is not bad. Read the world long Panasonic, read the autumn roots'; When my wife is interested, please ask her to draw these two poems. \" Hung-chien expressed his admiration. Mr.Wang said, \"Just now you said that the headmaster promised you a promotion. What did he tell you?\" Hung-chien said, \"He didn't say for sure, but he meant it.\" Mr.Wang shook his head and said, \"That doesn't count. This kind of thing is infuriating! Brother Hung-chien, when you first returned to China to teach, you didn't know much about the university. Of course, those who are famous and have special relationships are exceptions.",
        "e6c19adb-ae5f-4afc-84fd-4e62215516ba": "Mr.Wang took out the cigarette in his mouth and pointed to the four directions like a pointer: \"This scenery is not bad.

Brother Hung-chien, when you first returned to China to teach, you didn't know much about the university. Of course, those who are famous and have special relationships are exceptions. As for the promotion of general teachers, it can be said that it is easy for lecturers to be promoted to associate professors, but it is even more difficult for associate professors to be promoted to professors. When I was in Huayang University, they had such a comparison. The lecturer was better than a maid, the professor was better than a lady and an associate professor, which was equivalent to \"Madam-\"Hung-chien laughed-\"The difference between the two words can't be calculated. It is very common for a girl to accept a house as a concubine-at least in the past; If you want to be a big wife, you can't do it. Qian Qing doesn't have a deputy, does he? Wash your feet for Mrs.Ru; Give birth to the same Jinshi. \" A colleague in our department, who is also an associate professor, changed it to one sentence:' earn gas for Mrs.Ru; Wait for the associate professor to come out. \" Ha ha-\"Hung-chien said,\" Damn it! Being an associate professor will be ruined. \" -\"However, there is a way: the so-called' job-hopping' is rude. You can't become a professor in this school, but you can become a professor in another school. If our school doesn't allow you to leave, and the next school hires professors, then our school has to promote you to be a professor. The more you don't accept the formal and informal employment letters from the nearby schools, the more you should let the wind out to the school authorities, so that your treatment will be improved. Your business is on me; After the spring break, I asked my friend in Huayang Philosophy Department to write a letter asking me to invite you. I'll show the letter to President Gao first, and then I'll beat the drums a few times. He will definitely promote you, and you don't have to bother yourself at all. \"\r\nSome people are willing to be promoted like this, but they don't cheer themselves up. That's a real waste. Therefore, Hung-chien prepared his lessons and added special materials, and gradually dreamed of becoming a \"famous professor\". To get a degree is to coax the thesis into your husband; Teaching is to fool your students with handouts. Hung-chien didn't fool his teacher then, so he didn't get a degree. Now, if he wants to fool students, he will inevitably lack support. When a professor becomes a famous professor, there are two stages: the first is that the handout is a work, and the second book is a handout. For example, beginners' hairdressers first use the heads of fools and poor people as experiments to practice their skills, so the handouts are published as works when they are tried in class without any trouble; After publication, of course, it is a designated textbook. Since Hung-chien worked very hard, he could not help but have delusions of fame and fortune. He met Miss Sun several times and didn't go into details. All he knew was that she did what she said, without increasing or decreasing. Hsin-mei often goes to Wang's house. Hung-chien teased him and said, \"Be careful that Wang is jealous.\" Hsin-mei said solemnly, \"He doesn't have the mentality of a villain like you-besides, when I go, he is always away from home and only meets him once or twice.

        "d3429c14-3db1-4182-bf34-6e1fe3395b81": "He met Miss Sun several times and didn't go into details. All he knew was that she did what she said, without increasing or decreasing. Hsin-mei often goes to Wang's house. Hung-chien teased him and said, \"Be careful that Wang is jealous.\" Hsin-mei said solemnly, \"He doesn't have the mentality of a villain like you-besides, when I go, he is always away from home and only meets him once or twice. This old gentleman loves gambling and often goes to Wang's house. \" Hung-chien said that he wanted Li Mei-ting to win the money and stop making trouble.\r\nOn the fourth night of spring break, it was as warm as the previous nights. Gao Songnian came back from a dinner party in the town, drunk and happy, and suddenly he thought about it and went to the Wangs. His family is not here, and he returned to the bedroom deserted; If I don't go back, I feel that the night is not over yet. If I go back, the night will be over. It's just nine o'clock on the watch, but there's no one on the playground at the school gate. The reason is that during the holidays, students go home, travel, and some prepare for quizzes after spring break in the dormitory. There were frogs trying to sound in the four fields. Gao Songnian thought that the climate in this place was very early, and at the same time he thought of the spicy frog he ate last year. He knocked at the door twice, but no one answered. He remembered that Wang Jiaxin had changed her employment. Today might be her period, but the little girl wouldn't go out, so she pulled the bell rope on the door. This bell rope leads to the bedroom of the servant, which is originally intended for the master to come back late at night. Sleepy-eyed, my little girl dragged her shoes to open the door. When she saw that it was the headmaster, she held back her yawning and said that her master was not at home and had gone to the Wangs. President Gao's heart beat and asked his wife. My little girl said that she didn't go with her, and she led the college president into the living room. She was about to go in to ask her wife, but she touched her head and said that her wife seemed to have gone out, waking her up to close the door. Gao Songnian was angry and thought, \"Play cards! And play cards! One day, it will come to the ears of students, and it is time to warn Lao Wang and these people. \" He ordered the little girl to close the door and rushed to the Wangs in one breath. Wang Chuhou and others were so embarrassed to see that it was the headmaster that they quickly put away their cards. Mrs.Wang personally delivered tea and presented night snack snacks for gamblers to the headmaster. Gao Songnian saw that there was no Mrs.Wang, but said, \"Excuse me! Excuse me! \" He didn't advise them to continue fighting. Mr.Wang, I have something to discuss with you. Let's go first. Out of the door, Gao Songnian said, \"Where's Mrs.Wang?\" Wang Chu said kindly, \"She is at home.\" Gao Songnian said, \"I went to your house first, and the little girl said that she also went out.\" Wang Chuhou said with a mouthful: \"No! Never! \" To answer Gao Songnian and comfort myself at the same time, but my voice was hoarse.\r\nAlthough Zhao Xinmei's mouth was hard, he knew in his heart that Hung-chien's words were right and he should avoid suspicion. He likes Mrs.Wang very much because she has good looks and understanding. She is the only woman here who belongs to the same society as herself. Hsin-mei is confident that he is a moral gentleman and will never make jokes. During the spring break, he was lonely and bored. After dinner, he went to Wang's house to chat, but he couldn't open the door and wanted to go back. Suddenly the door opened, and Mrs.Wang opened it herself, saying, \"I don't think there is anyone else knocking at this time.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Why do you drive it yourself?\" Mrs.Wang said, \"One of the two servants has gone home, and the other is like a bird. He dozes off when it gets dark. It's easier for me to drive by myself than to wake her up.\"",

I came out for a walk and walked past your house, so I came to see you-and Mr.Wang.\" Mrs.Wang said with a smile, \"Chu Hou has gone to play cards and won't be back until eleven o'clock. I'd like to take a walk. Let's go together. You ring the bell at the door first, wake the little girl up, and I'll tell her to close the door. It's not cold outside, don't add clothes? \" In the dark outside the door, Hsin-mei heard her hand over the money to the maid and said, \"I'm going to Mr.Wang's house, too, and I'll go home with my master later. Don't sleep too hard! \" During the walk, Mrs.Wang asked Hsin-mei about her family, why she didn't get married, and whether she had ever had a lover-\"There must be, but I can't hide it.\" Hsin-mei gave a brief account of his affairs with Su Wenwan, but he couldn't stand Mrs.Wang's encouragement and spying, and the more detailed he became. The two talked happily and went to the door of Wang's house again. Mrs.Wang said with a smile, \"I was confused when I listened. Why did I come back? I'm tired, too. The Wangs won't go. Mr.Zhao, thank you for walking with me, especially for telling me many interesting things. \" Hsin-mei was a little embarrassed at this time, regretting that he was too insincere and came clean, and said, \"You're tired of listening. This kind of love story, I told it with relish, and others just thought it was ridiculous. I have had experience. \" Mrs.Wang said, \"I listened with interest, but Mr.Zhao, I want to give you a word of advice.\" Hsin-mei urged her to say that she wouldn't say anything, and she wanted to knock on the door. Hsin-mei stopped her and begged her to say something. She kicked off the pebbles at her feet and said, \"Remember, don't say hello to another woman-\"Hsin-mei's mind was dizzy after being hit, and she just said, \"Ah!\" \"Especially when I am such a bad-tempered and quick-talking person, I praise how gentle and quiet your young lady is.\" Hsin-mei shouted, \"Mrs.Wang, don't worry! I didn't mean it at all. To tell you the truth, I think you are similar to her in some ways-\"Mrs.Wang half pushed away his blocking hand and said,\" Nonsense! Nonsense! No one will be like me-\"suddenly the voice is near, and the two are busy separating.\r\nWang Chuhou was not as fast as Gao Songnian's young legs, and he was panting, and neither of them said a word. Coming to Wang's house, Gao Songnian had good eyes. In the translucent night, he saw two people twisting into a ball and headed straight for it. Wang Chuhou also heard the voices of his wife and men, and there was a red mist in front of him. When Hsin-mei was about to turn around, his shoulder was violently pulled, and Mrs.Wang's anxious breathing was heard in his ears. Looking back, it was Gao Songnian's face, showing his teeth, and his face was less than an inch away. Afraid and ashamed, he quickly shrugged his shoulders off Gao Songnian's hand. When Gao Songnian saw that it was Zhao Xinmei, he let go and said, \"How outrageous! Unbearable! \"",

Zhao Xinmei, you bastard! Shameless guy! Seduce a married woman. You don't want to blame, I saw you with my own eyes-you hugged-\"Mr.Wang was so angry that he couldn't go on. Hsin-mei stood up to speak, but held back. Mrs.Wang understood her husband's unfinished words and tried to get rid of his hand and said, \"Why don't you talk inside? My standing legs are a little sore, \"I reached out and rang the bell as soon as I stood on the wall. Her voice was unusually calm to suppress the tremor in her voice. People didn't expect her to say these words, and they were so surprised that they obediently followed her into the door. As soon as Hsin-mei stepped into the door, he realized and tried to slip away. Gao Songnian stopped him and said, \"No! I want to know what happened today. \"\r\nWhen Mrs.Wang entered the sitting room, she chose the most comfortable chair and sat down, asking the maid to pour herself a cup of tea. None of the three men sat down. Mr.Wang paced up and down, sighing one after another. Zhao Xinmei bowed his head and stood stupidly. President Gao pretended to look at the pictures on the wall with his hands behind his back. When the maid brought tea, Mrs.Wang said, \"Go to bed quickly, it's none of your business.\" She took a sip of tea and said slowly, \"What do you want to ask? It is getting late. I didn't bring my watch. Hsin-mei, what time is it? \"\r\nHsin-mei just ignored it. Gao Songnian gave him a bad look and was about to look at his watch. Wang Chuhou went to the round table and slapped the table with his hand, as if the judge had slapped him in the past, and shouted, \"I forbid you to talk to him. Honestly, what do you have to do with him? \"\r\n\"My relationship with him, I also forgot. Hsin-mei, what's our relationship? \"\r\nHsin-mei was overwhelmed with embarrassment. Gao Songnian was so angry that he clenched his fists and waved at him on airs. Wang Chu struck the table heavily and said, \"You-you say it quickly!\" Secretly wipe the sore palm on the thigh.\r\n\"You want me to be honest, good. But I advise you not to ask, you have seen it with your own eyes. Just know it in your heart. Why ask? Anyway, it's not a matter of glory and face. Why bother asking questions? Really! \"\r\nMr.Wang rushed at his wife like crazy, but President Gao took hold of him and said, \"Don't be angry! Ask him, ask him. \"\r\nAt the same time, Hsin-mei rubbed his hands and begged Mrs.Wang, \"Mrs.Wang, don't talk nonsense. I ask you-Mr.Wang, don't get me wrong. I have nothing to do with your wife.\" Today's thing is my fault, you listen to my explanation-\"\r\nMrs.Wang laughed wildly. \"You're only as bold as mustard seed-\"put your thumb nail on your fingertips and make a gesture-\"You're so afraid! You can't wash it off today, haha! President Gao, why do you come to entertain? It's not your place to be jealous. Let's just get this straight today, huh? Mr.Gao, ok? \"\r\nHsin-mei opened his eyes wide, looked at Kao Sung-nien, snorted, and turned away.",

No one stopped Hsin-mei, but Mrs.Wang followed him out with a burst of nervous laughter.\r\nHung-chien hasn't slept in his room. Hsin-mei came in like a drunk, blushing and staggering. Before Hung-chien could speak, he said, \"Hung-chien, I'm leaving this school soon, and I can't stay any longer.\" Hung-chien pressed Hsin-mei's shoulder in horror and asked him why. When Hsin-mei told him, Hung-chien thought, \"Terrible!\"! I can only say, \"Are you leaving tonight? Where do you want to go? \" Hsin-mei said that several letters from friends in Chongqing invited him. He stayed in a hotel in the town today and left early tomorrow morning. Knowing that there was no point in keeping him, Hung-chien was in a state of confusion and went up with him to pack his bags. Hsin-mei gave Hung-chien a dozen books he had brought, saying, \"I won't take these books with me. If you think they are evil in the future, donate them to the library for me.\" He also threw down the bedding in winter. After packing, Hsin-mei said, \"Oh, dear! I haven't written a letter to Gao Songnian. Do you want to ask him for leave or resign? Please take a long vacation. \" After writing the letter, give it to Hung-chien and send it tomorrow. Hung-chien woke up the janitor to pick up the luggage and sent Hsin-mei to the hotel, reluctantly. Hsin-mei said with a wry smile, \"Welcome to Chongqing in the second half of the year. It's best to say goodbye like this, simply. Go back to school and sleep-besides, when you go home in the summer vacation, take Miss Sun back to her father, unless she doesn't want to go back to Shanghai. \" When Hung-chien went back to school, it seemed as if it was suddenly dark in his own world. The janitor asked him why Mr.Zhao left, and he casually said that someone at home was sick. When the janitor asked if it was the old lady, he suddenly realized that Mrs.Zhao was alive and didn't want to ruin her, so he said, \"No, it's his old man.\"\r\nTomorrow, Hung-chien got up very late and was washing his face. The headmaster sent for him and said he would wait for him in the bedroom. He handed Hsin-mei's letter to someone to take it away first, and then went to the headmaster's bedroom. Gao Songnian listened to his arrival, tidied up his expression, and his face was thick enough to be scraped with a knife. He asked, \"When did Hsin-mei leave? Did he discuss it with you before he left? \" Hung-chien said, \"He only told me to leave. I left this town early this morning. \" Gao Songnian said, \"The school wants you to chase him back.\" Hung-chien said, \"He's very determined to go. If the headmaster goes after him himself, I don't think he may come back.\" Gao Songnian said, \"Do you know why he went?\" Hung-chien said, \"I know a little.\" Gao Songnian's face was like a shrimp and crab dipped in hot water and said, \"Then, I hope you will keep a secret for him. It's not good for him-er-for the school. \" Hung-chien bowed his head and learned, then spoke happily, \"phew\" for a long time.",
        "7d199792-8194-421d-9415-c542418f86cc": "He asked, \"When did Hsin-mei leave? Did he discuss it with you before he left? \" Hung-chien said, \"He only told me to leave.

It's not good for him-er-for the school. \" Hung-chien bowed his head and learned, then spoke happily, \"phew\" for a long time. Gao Songnian's nerves have been particularly keen since last night's incident. Hung-chien vomited this tone too early and it fell into his ears. He didn't curse \"bastard\" in his mouth, but his face instead of his mouth expressed the curse.\r\nBecause the school was still on holiday, the Academic Affairs Office didn't announce it, but many colleagues came to ask Hung-chien when they knew that Hsin-mei had asked for a long vacation. Hung-chien only said that he had received an urgent telegram from home and that someone was ill. It was not until the evening that Hung-chien had time to inform Miss Sun. On the way, he met her and said that he was coming to ask about Uncle Zhao. Hung-chien said, \"Your information is really clever. No wonder military spies use women.\"\r\nMiss Sun said, \"I'm not a spy. Miss Fan told me this, and she also said that Mrs.Wang had something to do with Uncle Zhao's leave. \"\r\nHung-chien stamped his foot and said, \"How does she know?\"\r\n\"She returned her book for Uncle Zhao. It seems that she had a falling out with Mrs.Wang and stopped going to the Wangs' house. At noon today, Mr.Wang sent a note saying that Mrs.Wang was ill and invited her to go. She didn't come back until then. Scold uncle Zhao, saying that he molested Mrs.Wang and made her angry. She also said that she had long seen through Uncle Zhao, so she ignored him. \"\r\n\"Hum, your uncle Zhao never called her precious darling. Do you know how this sentence was made?\"\r\nAfter listening to Hung-chien's lecture, Miss Sun thought, \"This is unreliable. I'm afraid she wrote it herself. Because she once asked me if' author' is an author or a writer in English. \"\r\nHung-chien spat and said, \"What a shame!\"\r\nMiss Sun walked a long way and said timidly, \"Uncle Zhao is gone! There are only two of us left. \"\r\nHung-chien stammered, \"When he left, he told me that if I went home and you wanted to go home, we could go together. But I am useless, you know, I can't take care of you. \"\r\nMiss Sun bowed her head and whispered, \"Thank you, Mr.Fang. I'm afraid I'm tired of Mr.Fang. \"\r\nHung-chien said politely, \"What nonsense!\"\r\n\"People want to gossip more,\" Miss Sun still lowered her head and voice.\r\nHung-chien was uneasy and pretended to be calm. \"Let them talk, as long as you don't care, I'm not afraid.\"\r\n\"I don't know what asshole-I suspect it's Lu Zixiao-writing an anonymous letter to dad, making-making rumors about you and me, and dad wrote to ask-\"\r\nWhen Hung-chien heard this, it was like half of the sky falling. At the same time, he heard someone calling from behind: \"Mr.Fang, Mr.Fang!\" Turning around, I saw that Li Meiting and Lu Zixiao had arrived. Miss Sun, like the siren of an ambulance in a hospital, was reduced by thousands of times, reaching out and pulling Hung-chien's right arm, as if begging him for protection. Knowing that Li Lu's eyes were all on his right arm, Hung-chien thought, \"It's over, it's over. Anyway, the rumors are known to the Sun family, so let it go. \"\r\nLu Zixiao stared at Miss Sun and was short of breath. Li Mei-ting smiled insidiously and said, \"You talked so closely that you didn't hear me when I called several times.",

Li Mei-ting smiled insidiously and said, \"You talked so closely that you didn't hear me when I called several times. I want to ask you when Hsin-mei left-Miss Sun, I'm sorry to interrupt your love story. \"\r\nHung-chien said desperately, \"You know it's a love story, so you shouldn't interrupt.\"\r\nLi Meiting said, \"Ha, you really got ahead of the trend, and you have to hook your hands when you walk during the day to set a good example for the students.\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"We can't learn from the example of the dean who is looking for flowers and asking for willows.\"\r\nLi Mei-ting turned pale. Seeing the wind, he turned and said, \"You like telling jokes best. Don't talk nonsense, seriously, when did you treat us to a wedding banquet? \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I won't miss you then.\"\r\nMiss Sun said hesitantly, \"Then let's tell Mr.Li-\"Li Meiting shouted, and Lu Zixiao screamed, \"Tell what? Engaged? Isn't it? \"\r\nMiss Sun hooked Hung-chien even tighter and didn't answer. The two men shouted, \"Congratulations! Congratulations, Miss Sun! Did you propose today? Treat! \" Forced to shake hands and said a lot of jokes.\r\nIf Hung-chien were in the clouds and lost his autonomy, he tried his best to hand in hand and clap his shoulders, and casually agreed to treat him, before the two of them would leave. When they had gone away, Miss Sun apologized and said, \"When I saw them, I panicked. I didn't know what to do. Please forgive Mr.Fang-I didn't mean what I just said. \"\r\nSuddenly, Hung-chien felt physically and mentally tired and had no energy to deal with it. He took her hand and said, \"I'm serious about every word. Maybe it's just what I asked. \"\r\nMiss Sun kept silent for a while and said, \"I hope you won't regret it.\" She looked back as if waiting for him to kiss her, but he forgot to kiss her and only said, \"I hope you won't regret it.\"\r\nOn the last day of spring break, colleagues all knew that Fang Hung-chien was engaged and would treat him next week. Li Mei-ting has talked privately in the past two days, which is more than the inculcation of students in the past year. He spread the news and said, \"There must be something wrong, or you wouldn't be engaged. You see, you will get married immediately after your engagement. In fact, why do it twice? Let's just move in together. Let's not care, eat him more anyway. In my opinion, it is most useful to give children clothes at the wedding ceremony. Ha ha! However, this is about the school discipline, and I will call the attention of the principal in the future. I am in charge of discipline and have my duty, so I can't just focus on my personal relationship with Fang Hung-chien, can I? I came with them all the way last year, and I felt that the number of roads was wrong. Only Lu Zixiao was a big grievance bucket! Haha. \" Therefore, on the day of the engagement banquet, many guests studied the outline of Miss Sun's body. When beets were served, several female guests maliciously forced Miss Sun to eat more, especially Mrs.Han even said, \"Sweets to the Sweet\" [7]. It is inevitable that someone will ask them to report their love story, but of course they will not. Li Meiting covered her face with wine and said, \"I'll report for them.\" Hung-chien looked at him warily and said, \"Mr.Li,' You are a good man!'\" Mei Ting was stupefied, and immediately remembered the widow in Suzhou. He laughed and said, \"Look at his eagerness to call me a' good man'.",

I got married early, and I will get divorced before I reach middle age. \" Everyone said that he was unlucky to speak, and he was fined a glass of wine. Hung-chien and Miss Sun were also drunk by the guests.\r\nThose who were invited that day were Mr.and Mrs.Wang and Mr.Liu. Liu Dongfang blamed Hung-chien for his sister's unsuccessful marriage. Originally, he had a plan to hold an exhibition of English composition results after spring break, taking the opportunity to expose the omissions of Hung-chien's pen change. Unexpectedly, most students are so secretive about their own papers that they refuse to take them out to show their ugliness. At the same time, Hsin-mei has left school. If Hung-chien is angry and doesn't teach English, no one will come to take his place. A gentleman can bend and stretch, and he let Hung-chien finish teaching this semester. If Mrs.Han hadn't sent the shirts and leather shoes to his eldest daughter at the end of the semester, he and the Han family could have made peace long ago, and there was no need to wait until next semester to give Hung-chien's homework as a gift. Wang Chuhou no longer invited colleagues and principals home for dinner. Liu Dongfang complained that he didn't try his best as a matchmaker. Zhao Xinmei left again, and Wang School was dissolved invisibly. He was ready to resign and return to Chengdu. Although President Gao is a witness to Hung-chien's engagement, he is not satisfied with him. Li Meiting's prediction about marriage has not been confirmed. It happened that Lu Zixiao went to Hung-chien's room and saw a pamphlet entitled \"Home University Library\", a fashionable book \"On Communism\" written by Laski, which was originally left by Hsin-mei. Although Lu Zixiao's foreign language is as incomprehensible as a badly injured nose, the word Communism on the cover is familiar and shocking. He informed Dean Li orally, and Dean Li reported it to President Gao in writing. The headmaster said, \"I was going to promote him to a higher level, but who knows that he has something wrong with his mind and can only be dismissed next semester.\" This man is a genius, what a pity! Unfortunately! \" Therefore, Hung-chien can't even be \"like a lady\" and can only \"go to class\". Before he left, he gave all Hsin-mei's books to the library, including the pamphlet. When Han Xueyu got the news that Hung-chien had stopped hiring, he pulled Mrs.Belarus to jump around the house like a frog and a flea, and his secret would never be revealed by a middleman. On the evening of July 4th, the day after the final exam, he invited his colleagues and invited his wife to come forward on the invitation, on the pretext of National Day, which of course proved that his wife was a real American.

The stupid donkey thought that if he took the previous step, the radish would reach his mouth, so he continued to move forward step by step. The more he bit his mouth, the more his feet would catch up, and he unconsciously took another stop. Whether it can eat this bunch of radishes at that time depends on the happiness of the donkey man. In all organs, bosses use this skill to control their subordinates; For example, Gao Songnian allowed Hung-chien to promote him to professor next school year. Ever since Hsin-mei left, Hung-chien's eyes have been full of upgrading this carrot, and his mouth suddenly stopped craving and he wanted to find another way after the summer vacation. When he was only ready to send the employment contract, the original was returned with a letter, which was a farewell message to vent his anger over the past year. He hasn't decided the wording of this letter in detail, because he doesn't know what kind of employment contract the principal's office will give him. Sometimes he hopes that the appointment will remain as an associate professor, and he can reply with confidence and blame Gao Songnian for breaking his promise. Sometimes he wants to be promoted to a professor by appointment, so that his letter can be more beautiful, indicating that his dissatisfaction is not out of personal resentment, but entirely for business. Unexpectedly, Gao Songnian saved him the trouble of writing a letter, and simply didn't send him an appointment. Miss Sun did have an engagement, and her salary was raised by one level. Some people say that this is a joke played by Gao Songnian, and they deliberately split them up. Gao Songnian himself said that this was his fair handling, and his fiancee would never be tied down for her fiance-\"Don't say that they are not married yet, that is, they are married and have children, and their husbands have problems with their thoughts, and they can't' blame their wives'. In the 20th century, the Republic of China should run higher education, and this democratic style should be possessed.\" Knowing that Miss Sun had received the employment contract, Hung-chien inquired about other colleagues carefully, only to find that the employment contract had been widely issued in the next school year, and even Han Xueyu's foreign wife was among them, and only she was like the tail-less fox in Aesop's fable. This made his mind fever and his body cold. Planned actions and words, all unnecessary, stuffy in the heart fermentation. This is even more unpleasant than a student who has studied well and then suddenly postponed the exam. When Gao Songnian met, he was always smiling as if nothing had happened. Administrative people have their social ways. Between ourselves, any frills and bad temper will do; The closer you smile, the more courteous you are, and the deeper your mutual suspicion or resentment. Kao Sung-nien hasn't got home yet. His smile and politeness are like antiques copied by bad hands, full of flaws, and it is obvious that they are fake. Hung-chien tried to question him several times, but on second thought he held back. In a quarrel, the one who speaks first may not have the upper hand, and then the one who keeps silent is considered a victory. Kao Sung-nien's face was motionless. He must have been careful. He was bold and provocative. He refused to come to Taiwan, but instead smiled at him and made a scene. People always said that the surname Fang's job was broken and he was ashamed and angry.",

Giving him a nonchalant gesture shows that he doesn't care about his job, which is a wonderful way to save face. What is unbearable is the attitude of those colleagues. They seemed to know all about their dismissal, but because it was not made public, their sympathy had to be given away in an envelope. People who are often very distant on weekdays suddenly come to visit. He knew that their purpose was to take a breath, so he didn't say a word, but the regret contained in their spirit and speech was always like a gift that Santa Claus put in his socks, and he would not leave until he gave it. This kind of sympathy is even worse than ridicule. As soon as the guest turned his back, Hung-chien gritted his teeth and swore a combination of Chinese and Western: \"To Hell, fuck you!\"\r\nSun Roujia used to visit Hung-chien before he got engaged. Being engaged, only Hung-chien went to see her, and she refused to come easily. At first, Hung-chien thought that she was just a girl and had to ask herself everything. After the engagement, he gradually found that she was not only very opinionated, but also very firm. She heard that he was going to return the employment contract, but she didn't agree, saying that it was not easy to find a job, unless he had other plans, don't be impulsive. Hung-chien asked, \"Do you like staying here? Didn't you say you were going home as soon as you came? \" She said, \"It's different now. As long as we are together, anywhere is fine. \" Hung-chien was naturally glad to see his fiancee with reason and emotion, but he didn't want to do what she said. He felt that although he was engaged, he was still a stranger to her. I have no engagement experience in the past-it doesn't count with the Zhou family-I don't know if the mood after engagement should be as dull as it is now. He explained to himself that passionate love has long been the culmination of engagement, and once marriage is over, everything is over. Now that we are engaged, there is still room for emotional development between us, which is a good thing. He remembered what the goatee philosopher said in a moral philosophy class in London: \"There are only two kinds of people in the world. For example, when you get a bunch of grapes, one person chooses the best and eats it first, while the other person saves the best for last. As usual, the first person should be optimistic, because every grape he eats is the best among the leftover grapes; The second person should be pessimistic, because every one he eats is the worst grape left over. But in fact, it is counterproductive, because the second person still has hope, and the first person only has memories. \" From falling in love to growing old together, it is like a bunch of grapes. There is always the best one, and there is only one best one. Keep it for hope. How much is good? He told her these words quickly, but she was silent. When he talked to her, all she answered was \"hmm\" and \"oh\". He asked her why she was unhappy, and she said she was not unhappy. He said, \"You can't hide it from me.\" She said, \"I wish you knew. I'm going back to the dormitory. \" Hung-chien said, \"No, you can't leave until you make it clear.\" She said, \"I must go.\" Hung-chien coaxed and begged her all the way, and then she said, \"The good grapes you want are behind. We are bad grapes. Don't spoil your appetite.\"",

We are bad grapes. Don't spoil your appetite.\" He was so anxious that he jumped up and said she was fooling around. She said, \"I knew you didn't really love me, otherwise you wouldn't have that strange idea.\" He explained it carefully for a long time, and her face calmed down. She smiled sweetly and said, \"I'm a die-hard, and you'll hate it in the future.\" Hung-chien kissed her and effectively cut her off, then said, \"You are really a sour grape today.\" She forced Hung-chien to reveal his past love. He refused to speak, and he couldn't stand her repeated pressure. He spoke a little. She didn't think it was enough. Hung-chien, like a rich man who was tortured by robbers and confessed his assets, confided more one after another. She didn't think it was detailed, and said, \"You are really unhappy! Will I eat this old vinegar after years? I am listening to fun. \" Hung-chien saw that her cheeks were slightly red and her mouth was forced to smile. He was glad that he had seen the opportunity early and concealed most of the plot. She wanted to see the photos of Su Wenwan and Tang Xiaofu, and she finally believed that Hung-chien really didn't have any photos of them. She said, \"You always kept a diary at that time. It must be very interesting. Do you have them with you?\" Hung-chien shouted, \"How outrageous! I'm not one of those writers and literati that Fan Yi knows. Why should I keep a diary when I'm in love? If you don't believe me, search in my bedroom. \" \"Keep your voice down,\" said Miss Sun. \"People have heard everything, so they have something to say. Only me! I can't stand your rudeness. Why don't you invite Miss Su and Miss Tang to try? \" Hung-chien was not angry. She looked at his face and said with a smile, \"Are you angry with me? Why are you looking away? It's my fault. I'm kidding you. Apologize! Apologize! \"\r\nSo, after being engaged for a month, Hung-chien seemed to have a mistress. Although he didn't train her to be tame, he admired her training skills. He remembered that Chao Hsin-mei had said that the girl was interested, which was true. I am six years older than her, and I have much more experience in the world. I am already a person of the previous generation. I only think that she is fun, and everything indulges her and does not care about her seriously. When the letter of appointment happened, Miss Sun generously said, \"Of course I will return my letter of appointment-but why don't you ask Gao Songnian directly? Maybe he missed one of you unintentionally. You are embarrassed yourself, and you can ask someone else to ask. \" Hung-chien didn't listen to her. Later, she learned that the letter of appointment was not unintentionally omitted, so she didn't force him. Hung-chien joked, \"I lost my job in the second half of the year, so we can't get married. I will starve if you marry me. \" She said, \"I didn't want you to feed me either. Go home and see dad and ask him to think of a way for you. \" He advocated not going home at all, and going to Chongqing to find Zhao Xinmei. Xinmei joined the National Defense Commission, and his letter was quite proud. Compared with the embarrassment when he left, he was like a different person.",

Xinmei joined the National Defense Commission, and his letter was quite proud. Compared with the embarrassment when he left, he was like a different person. Unexpectedly, she objected greatly, saying that Hsin-mei and he were just people in the same position, and it was a shame to ask him for advice. He also said that San Lv University was recommended by Hsin-mei. \"As a handyman for various departments, the professor didn't climb up, and even the associate professor couldn't keep it. Is Hsin-mei's recommendation good?\" Hung-chien said awkwardly, \"It makes my position even worse. Would you please speak with dignity? \" Miss Sun said that in any case, she would go back to see her father and mother once, and he should also meet her future father-in-law. Hung-chien said, let's get married here. It will save trouble on the one hand, and it will be more convenient to travel on the other. Miss Sun said thoughtfully, \"This engagement has not been approved by my parents. Fortunately, they like me and it is not difficult at all. Marriage can't be so hasty, let them decide. Don't be afraid, dad is not fierce, he will like you. \" Hung-chien suddenly remembered something and said, \"Our engagement was prompted by your father's letter. I really want to see when you pick it out. \" Miss Sun wait for a while's eyes asked questions. Hung-chien gently twisted her nose and said, \"How did you forget? It is the letter that talks about anonymous letters. \" Miss Sun turned to shake off his hand and said, \"Damn it! Your nose is red. That letter? I read the letter at that time, and when I got angry, I tore it up-well, I really should have kept it, and now we are not afraid of rumors, \"he said, clutching his hand.\r\nWhen Hsin-mei got the news of Hung-chien's engagement in Chongqing, he sent an air express to congratulate him. Hung-chien showed this letter to Miss Sun, and she read the last line: \"My brother's words on the boat have been tested, hehe. By the way, \"ask him what he said on the boat. Now that Hung-chien is newly engaged, it's natural for his friends to be relaxed and tell Hsin-mei's criticisms one by one. She was angry when she heard this, but she didn't attack. She just said, \"You men are shameless. It's shameless to always say that women take a fancy to you and don't look at yourself in the mirror! Maybe Lu Zixiao tells everyone how to take a fancy to him! I'm unlucky, too. Hsin-mei must have spoken ill of me. Tell me. \" Hung-chien was busy talking nonsense. She is opposed to entrusting Zhao Xinmei with affairs, which may be the reason. Hung-chien said that when he went back this time, he wouldn't go the same way. He simply flew from Guilin to Hong Kong, saving a lot of suffering, and asked Hsin-mei to try to get a plane ticket. Miss Sun is very much in favor. Hsin-mei wrote back: His mother went to Hong Kong from Tianjin at the end of July, and he was going to welcome her to Chongqing. At that time, they happened to be able to chat in Hong Kong. Miss Sun read the letter and frowned. \"I don't want to see him. He's joking. You forbid him to joke. \" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"You can't avoid joking when you meet for the first time, and there will be no more. What are you afraid of now? You've been promoted for a generation, and it's time for him to call you Shisao. \"",
        "151c2a67-1381-40a4-aa5c-dc35af8004c7": "He simply flew from Guilin to Hong Kong, saving a lot of suffering, and asked Hsin-mei to try to get a plane ticket. Miss Sun is very much in favor.

You've been promoted for a generation, and it's time for him to call you Shisao. \"\r\nWhen Hung-chien left this time, none of his colleagues sent him a farewell party. Since the headmaster is not happy with him, everyone is too lazy to contact him. He doesn't look like a man who can succeed in the official career-\"Sun Roujia is really blind to marry him, and he will regret it one day\"-the meal he is invited to eat may not be like bread thrown in the Nile River, but it will float back to its original owner in a few days. Moreover, inviting guests to dinner is like sowing seeds: some of the guests who came here ate without invitation, such as the top boss and junior clerk; There are several people who will definitely return to the table, such as colleagues with equal status and income, so that you can reap several meals by planting one meal. Hung-chien's position is not high, and he doesn't belong to any department. Usually, no one makes friends with him. He is only friendly with Hsin-mei, and he doesn't sow rice seeds among his colleagues. However, although Hung-chien didn't get the meal, he thanked him several times. When people asked about his departure date, they said regretfully, \"What's the matter? Go in such a hurry! It's too late to say goodbye. Shit! It happened that I was too busy to take the big exam again these days. Miss Sun advised him to leave a few days later, so everyone would take it easy-okay, okay, yes, then it would be impolite. You go back to the wedding, give an early notice, don't hide it from others! Two people are happily married and forget all their old friends here. That's no good! Haha. \" President Gao invited the provincial government to the provincial capital for a meeting. He didn't go back to school until the final exam, and never formally talked about the letter of appointment. The day before Hung-chien left, he went to the secretariat of the principal's office to ask for travel documents, so as to avoid the trouble of the military and police on the road. By the way, he saw the principal say goodbye, and Gao Songnian had not yet arrived at the office. In the afternoon, he went to the secretariat to get his certificate. When he asked the headmaster, he had already left. The heads of all organs go to the office, which is like the sun in the middle of winter or the good luck in a lifetime. They come late and go early. However, Gao Songnian has always been diligent and sensitive, and Hung-chien guessed that he was afraid of himself and avoided himself, and he was a little proud in anger. Several students he coached had time to come to his room to say goodbye in the evening because the exam was finished that day. He likes it gratefully, and only then can he understand that corrupt officials need a place to stay, offer an umbrella to all people, and set up a monument to virtue. Leaving a place is equivalent to dying once, knowing that death is inevitable, and always hoping that others will express their willingness to live by themselves. The reputation after death is just as concerned as the sorrow and glory after death, and I can't know it. I am deeply afraid of going or dying, like a foreign candle going out, leaving only a bad smell. Some people bid farewell, as if the dying person had a dutiful son and grandchildren, and he closed his eyes with peace of mind. These students come and go, and the temporary excitement adds to his loneliness, and he can't sleep at midnight. Although I hate this place, when I left, I was disappointed that I couldn't come back later. People's hearts are so unpredictable. When I came last year, only two of my companions went back now.",

Fortunately, Jou-chia was there, otherwise I would have lost my job and walked this long road alone. I really didn't have the courage. Thinking of this place, Hung-chien felt a little warm psychologically like a huddled body on a winter night, and only hated that she was not around. Before dawn, the bearers and porters came; It's summer, so it's cool before it's too late. The janitor who served Hung-chien put on a sweatshirt and sent them blindfolded to the gate to watch them get on the sedan chair, clutching Hung-chien's reward in one hand and preparing the sedan chair to go and count. Miss Fan's nearsighted eyes became blurred because of lack of sleep. She thought that she would meet a male colleague who saw her off, smeared some rouge on her face, hooked Miss Sun's hand and sent her from the girls' dormitory. Miss Sun also said goodbye and couldn't leave her. Miss Fan watched her get on the sedan chair, wishing them a safe journey, and said that she would definitely forward the letter sent to Miss Sun to Shanghai. \"But how do you write this address? I'm going to prescribe the address of Mr.Fang's house, \"he said with a giggle.\" Miss Sun also said that there must be a letter for her. Hung-chien sniggered that women are born politicians. They slander each other behind their backs, and their faces are so affectionate. I'm afraid that the two political opponents' efforts to clink glasses at a champagne party are just so much. If I hadn't heard them mean to each other with my own ears, I would have thought they were really good friends.\r\nThe sedan-chair bearer arrived in the town to finish the morning rush, and sedan chair was about to hit the road when Gao Songnian's relatives arrived, full of sweat, and handed Hung-chien a large envelope, saying that it had been delivered on the orders of the principal. Hung-chien thought it was a letter of appointment, and his heart beat so hard that he quickly opened the envelope, which contained only a piece of stationery and a red paper bag. According to the letter, there was a lot of school affairs this month, so I didn't have a chance to talk with Hung-chien in detail. I just came back from the provincial capital the day before yesterday, and I was in a hurry to leave, so I'm very sorry that Hung-chien couldn't say goodbye. Our school temporarily suspended the philosophy department, and it was really a pity to keep him here, so I wrote to two famous academic institutions and recommended him to do things. As soon as there was news, I decided to send a telegram to Shanghai. A gift certificate is a wedding gift, which is still appreciated. Before he finished reading it, Hung-chien was so angry that he wanted to jump off the sedan chair and scold it. He endured until the sedan chair bearer walked ten miles to rest, handed a paper ball to Miss Sun and said, \"Look at the letter from Gao Songnian! Who wants him to give gifts? When I arrive in Hengyang, I will register and return it. Very good! I was just about to write a letter to scold him, but I hate that there was no reason. His letter gave me a good opportunity to reply and scold him. \" Miss Sun said, \"I think his letter is also well-intentioned. Why are you an empty enemy? What good will it do you to scold him? Maybe he really introduced you to someone? \" Hung-chien said angrily, \"You're always preaching the truth, so you can't let anyone do it with satisfaction. The more reasonable you are, the more unreasonable I am. \" Miss Sun said, \"It's very hot. I'm already thirsty.",
        "b1947c30-862b-4f58-bb0d-eca0ed54aa9c": "Who wants him to give gifts? When I arrive in Hengyang, I will register and return it. Very good!

There are still four days to Hengyang, and then you will write and scold Gao Songnian, and I will never stop you. \" Knowing that he would not be able to thank her by that time, Hung-chien became even more angry. Instead of pouring water for her, he just shoved the marching thermos bottle at her and said, \"This gift of his is outrageous. We haven't set a wedding date yet. Why did he say in his letter that I've finished with you? He has a purpose. I'll tell you. Because you and I are going the same way, he thought-\"Miss Sun said,\" Stop it! You are the most caring person, and you are full of evil intentions! \" When he said this, he still made Gao Songnian's letter into a ball and threw it in the pool beside the field bank. She just drank hot water, and her face was still red when she got into the sedan chair.\r\nIn order to fly tickets, they stayed in Guilin for more than ten days. They were so happy that they didn't feel like people were living, but it seemed that days had passed them by. Both pieces of luggage were handed over to the transportation company introduced by Hsin-mei. It is said that they can be shipped to Shanghai in more than a month. I have enough travel expenses around me, so I don't care if I stay a few more days. It was sunny the day before boarding the plane, but it suddenly rained that night, and it stopped raining in the morning, which was a little cloudy and foggy. It was the first time for them to fly. They were very uncomfortable and vomited like sick cats. When they landed in Hong Kong, Hsin-mei met them at the airport, and both Hung-chien's energy was exhausted, which could not express the joy of reunion after such a long separation. Seeing that they were pale, Hsin-mei said, \"Did you throw up? It doesn't matter. You always have to pay some tax for the first time you fly. I'll accompany you to the hotel to have a good rest, and I'll get you a dinner in the evening. \" When they arrived at the hotel, Hung-chien and Jou-chia were anxious to have a rest. Seeing that they only booked one room, Hsin-mei secretly stuck his tongue out against the wall. On the way up the hill to his relatives' home, he smiled alone and then frowned and sighed.\r\nHung-chien slept for a while, regained his energy, changed his clothes and waited for Hsin-mei to come. The noise of playing cards in the next room and the noise of clogs in the street kept Miss Sun awake, and she felt sick and nauseous. She leaned back on the sofa and said that she didn't want to go out today. Hung-chien was in a hurry and advised her to pull herself together and not disappoint Hsin-mei. She instructed Hung-chien to go alone, and said, \"You two have something to say, but I can't get a word in, so I'll be an idiot. He didn't invite a female guest next to him. It doesn't matter if I have one more person and one less person today. I'm telling you, the restaurant he treats must be very spacious, and I have no clothes. It's a shame to go. \" Hung-chien said, \"I didn't know you were so vain! That flowered cheongsam can still be worn. \" Miss Sun said with a smile, \"I haven't spent your money on clothes, and I've been scolded for my vanity. I want you to pay the tailor's bill for me in the future! That cheongsam is so old-fashioned.",
        "13427589-b855-491f-9f4d-fec8721b1641": "She instructed Hung-chien to go alone, and said, \"You two have something to say, but I can't get a word in, so I'll be an idiot.

I want you to pay the tailor's bill for me in the future! That cheongsam is so old-fashioned. When I came to the hotel, I saw a woman's cheongsam on the street along the way, and the cuffs and lower lapels were much shorter. I don't have any white leather shoes. I'm afraid to move when I go to buy a pair at this time, and my stomach is still very uncomfortable. \" When Hsin-mei came, she knew that Miss Sun was ill, and hurriedly said that dinner would be rescheduled. She forbade them to eat out. Hsin-mei said with relief, \"Fang-er-Miss Sun, how kind of you! In the future, she will be a good wife of great virtue. If the woman next to her were changed, she would guard Hung-chien tightly and never let him move freely. Hung-chien, will you give her up for a while? Honestly, don't blame me behind Lao Zhao's back for separating you two. \" Hung-chien looked at Miss Sun imploringly and said, \"Do you really need me to accompany you?\" Seeing his expression, Miss Sun forced a smile: \"Go ahead, I'm not seriously ill-Mr.Zhao, I'm really sorry-\"Hsin-mei said: \"What a joke! Today, I'm making an empty invitation. When you recover, please live a good life. So, I took him away. An hour and a half later, I sent him back, and the original thing was returned, and there was no loss, haha! Hung-chien, go! No, you may have a simple ceremony for lovers to say goodbye. I'll wait for you by the elevator first-\"Hung-chien pulled him away and said,\" Don't be ridiculous. \"\r\nWhen Hsin-mei was a student in the political department of an American university, she listened in on a course of \"Diplomatic Psychology\". That gentleman has worked as a counsellor of the legation for several times. In class, he said: Americans ask for dinner when they negotiate. As soon as they sit down, they will get down to business before the food is served. Europeans only talk about irrelevant nonsense when eating, and then get down to business after eating coffee. He asked Hsin-mei how people in China were, but Hsin-mei giggled and couldn't answer. Hsin-mei also has serious words to tell Hung-chien, but today's dinner is a gathering of two good friends. If we leave serious words on the table, it will ruin the scenery. He went out of the hotel and said, \"You haven't eaten western food for half a year. I'll treat you to an Austrian restaurant. The road is not far, and it's still early. Let's walk slowly and talk more. \" Hung-chien just said, \"In fact, why do you spend money?\" He was about to say, \"You look better than then. You want to be an official!\" Hsin-mei coughed and coughed, but looked straight. He said, \"Why don't you travel after you get married?\"\r\nHung-chien suddenly remembered that all the way to the hotel was in the name of \"Mr.and Mrs.Fang\". Today, when he got off the plane, he was dizzy and didn't pay attention to this. He was only glad that Hsin-mei was walking and wouldn't see his feverish face. He quickly said, \"I asked for this, too. She refused to go back to Shanghai and get married.\"\r\n\"Then, you are too weak.\"",

Let's walk slowly and talk more. \" Hung-chien just said, \"In fact, why do you spend money?\" He was about to say, \"You look better than then. You want to be an official!\" Hsin-mei coughed and coughed, but looked straight. He said, \"Why don't you travel after you get married?\"\r\nHung-chien suddenly remembered that all the way to the hotel was in the name of \"Mr.and Mrs.Fang\". Today, when he got off the plane, he was dizzy and didn't pay attention to this. He was only glad that Hsin-mei was walking and wouldn't see his feverish face. He quickly said, \"I asked for this, too. She refused to go back to Shanghai and get married.\"\r\n\"Then, you are too weak.\" Hsin-mei thinks that this English word is beautifully embedded, and it is worthy of diplomatic words: if Hung-chien has nothing to do with Miss Sun, this word means that he can't make up his mind, and whether to get married or not is entirely at her mercy; If the two of them are not what they expected, but the flesh is weak[1], the word goes without saying that it is implicit and muddy, and it is best not to have it.\r\nHung-chien, like a convicted prisoner, can't deny it. He just dies and makes his face turn red steadily. \"I regret it, too,\" he muttered. But I have to go home anyway. Etiquette is very troublesome, so leave it to your family. \"\r\n\"Is Miss Sun vomiting and unable to eat?\"\r\nWhen Hung-chien heard him change direction, he was relieved and said, \"Yes! Today, the plane oscillated badly. However, I'm all right now. Maybe she was tired and got up too early today. She took care of everything for both of us last night. Hsin-mei, do you remember? That time at the Wangs' dinner, Fan Yi made a rumor about her, saying that she wouldn't pack her things-\"\r\n\"The plane shock should have passed. We walked the same way last year, and the car was so bumpy that she never threw up. Maybe there are other reasons? I heard that I was going to throw up-\"followed by a light and quick sentence-\"Of course I have no experience, \"and forced a smile without humor.\r\nHung-chien didn't expect Hsin-mei to return to that question, as if the people who were hiding from the air raid thought the plane had gone far, only to find that it had turned around and dropped bombs. He was so scared that he forgot to feel ashamed and angry and just said, \"That won't happen! That won't! \" At the same time, I was afraid and knew that it would be good.\r\nHsin-mei chewed the handle of his pipe and said, \"Hung-chien, you and I are good friends. Although I am not Miss Sun's legal protector, I have finally been entrusted by her father-I advise you two to get married by the simplest procedure without going to Shanghai for a ceremony. Anyway, your tickets won't be available until a week later, so just stay for four or five more days, even on your honeymoon, and take the next boat back. Needless to say, many relatives and friends will come to the wedding banquet when they go home to get married, and this expense is not small. I know the situation of the saying family, and your father may not be well off, so why not save it? Why should they host your marriage? \" Apart from economic reasons, he also cited other interests to prove that the sooner the marriage, the better. Hung-chien convinced him, as if a heavy difficulty had been broken, and said, \"I'll tell Jou-chia this later. I'd like to ask you if there is a registered marriage here, and the procedures are not complicated. \"\r\nHsin-mei was very happy to realize that his mission had been completed. At dinner, he asked for a bottle of wine and said, \"Remember that time when you got me drunk? Ha ha! I'm sorry for getting drunk today, Miss Sun. \" He asked many questions about school and sighed, \"It's like having a nightmare-how is she?\" Hung-chien said, \"Who? Mrs.Wang? I heard that she is well, and I have never been to the Wang family. \"",

I understand that. Their marriage will not end, unless Wang Chuhou is dying, and divorce is allowed. What's your pity? It's your fault that you don't get married, not to mention Fan Yi, but Mrs.Wang-\"Hsin-mei blushed to the extreme after drinking, but he didn't get redder when he heard this, and his eyes blinked evasively-\"OK, I won't go on. I lost my job, of course, poor; Miss Sun is pitiful, is it because she is wrong for me? \" Hsin-mei said, \"No, no. You don't understand. \" Hung-chien said, \"Why don't you say it?\" Hsin-mei said, \"I won't say.\" Hung-chien said, \"I think you have a girlfriend recently.\" Hsin-mei asked, \"What does this mean?\" Hung-chien said, \"Because what you say is all coquetry, you must have been influenced by someone.\" Hsin-mei said, \"Bastard! So, I told you, huh? Didn't I tell you that Miss Sun has a deep heart? This time, according to my third party, she took great pains-\"Hung-chien's sleepy thoughts seemed to be awakened by Hsin-mei's words-\"No, no, I'm drunk, and I'm talking nonsense. Hung-chien, you mustn't tell your wife. I'm so confused, I forgot that you're not the same as you used to be, and you'll have to draw a line when your old friends talk, \"he said, scratching his knife in the air an inch away from the table.\" Hung-chien said, \"It's really a betrayal to tell you that marriage is so terrible.\" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"It's not that you are betraying your relatives, it's that you are betraying your relatives. These words are no longer talked about. Let me ask you, what are your plans after the summer vacation? \" Hung-chien told him that he was going to look for trouble. Hsin-mei said that the international situation was very bad, and a dozen European countries were inevitable. Japan was an axis country, and it would be brought in sooner or later. Shanghai, Tianjin and Hong Kong were all unstable, so he took his mother to Chongqing. \"But you are afraid to stay in Shanghai for some time this time. Would you like to work in my old newspaper office for a few months? There is a director of the reference room who is going to the mainland. I will introduce you to fill his vacancy. Although the reward is not good, you can take a part-time job. \" Hung-chien sincerely thanked him. Hsin-mei asked him if he had enough money around him. Hung-chien said that getting married always costs some money, and I don't know if it's enough. Hsin-mei said that he would borrow it. Hung-chien said, \"If you borrow it, you have to return it.\" Hsin-mei said, \"I'll pay you a sum of money the day after tomorrow. It's a gift from me. You must bear it.\" Hung-chien was protesting warmly when Hsin-mei stopped him and said, \"I advise you not to push. If I were married, I would have no freedom to lend money to my friends at that time. \"",

He didn't know how much he wanted to thank Hsin-mei. Instead, he shed tears for the money. Knowing that Hsin-mei didn't want to be thanked, he said, \"I read between the lines that you are getting married, too. Don't keep it from me.\" Hsin-mei ignored him, told Xizai to fetch his suit jacket, took out his wallet, and dug for a long time like a mine. He solemnly picked out a small photo of a girl with bright eyes and a very serious expression. Hung-chien looked at it and shouted, \"Great! Great! Who is it? \" Hsin-mei took the photo, studied it carefully, and said with a smile, \"Don't praise it too enthusiastically. I will be jealous after listening to it. We have misunderstood before. Looking at the photos of friends and lovers, politeness is enough, and enthusiasm is not needed. \" Hung-chien said, \"How outrageous! Who is she? \" Hsin-mei said, \"Her father was a friend of my late father's from Sichuan. I went to stay at his house at first.\" Hung-chien said, \"As you are, the older generation is a friend, and the next generation becomes a relative, and the friendship will never end. Ok, our future children-\"Miss Sun's symptoms came to mind and she consciously said something wrong-\"Well-I think she is very young. Is she studying? \" Hsin-mei said, \"If you don't want to study liberal arts well, you have to learn fashion and study electrical engineering. You are complaining bitterly. After the summer vacation, the report came, but two subjects failed and could not be promoted. The child was proud and refused to transfer to another department. In this case, I will stop studying and be willing to marry me. Haha, what a silly child. I'd like to thank those two gentlemen who failed her. I won't teach any more. If you teach, you will be more strict with the scores of female students, which will contribute to countless good things and benefit countless people. \" Hung-chien said with a smile, no wonder he wanted to take the old lady in. Hsin-mei looked at the photo again, put it in his wallet, looked at his watch and shouted, \"Oh, no, after that, Miss Sun will be angry!\" Scrambling to calculate the account, he said, \"Let's go! Do you want me to take you back and hand it in face to face? \" When they entered the restaurant, it was still a tentative night before dusk, and when they came out, it was already night. But this is a summer night with fine subtropical weather. The night is frank and simple, and there is no deep and unpredictable talent, just like letting Shakespeare direct A Midsummer Night's Dream.People have a background role model. Hsin-mei looked at Heaven and said, \"Nice weather! I wonder if there will be an air raid in Chongqing tonight. Mother will be too scared to go. I'll turn on the radio and listen to the news. \"\r\nHung-chien was so full that he couldn't speak Cantonese. Afraid of being entangled with foreign drivers, he strolled back to the hotel alone. Hsin-mei's talk aroused many thoughts. One should be proud. People who are proud have wonderful conversations, such as Hsin-mei. In the past year, I have been full of complaints and are on the verge of exploding; Because I never like to hear people complain, I guess people may not like to hear their own complaints.",

In the past year, I have been full of complaints and are on the verge of exploding; Because I never like to hear people complain, I guess people may not like to hear their own complaints. Pay attention to control, like a dog wearing a muzzle, and the conversation is not happy. According to Hsin-mei, the war will only prolong and add to the family's burden. If Jou-chia's illness is really guessed by Hsin-mei-Hung-chien is so ashamed and afraid that he wants to go elsewhere-Hsin-mei likes that girl very much, which is obvious, but it doesn't seem to be warm love. Otherwise, his tone of speaking about her will not be so humorous. He may treat her just like himself to Jou-chia, so it is enough to get married without great love and not hate each other. Is it because the age difference between men and women is too far? But what about Tang Xiaofu last year? Maybe just for Tang Xiaofu, I've run out of emotions and won't push myself around any more. That kind of emotion, in retrospect, is terrible. It disturbs people to do things, eat and sleep, and does not spare people for a moment. It's just mental derangement. Really! However, having this disease has its happiness, and sometimes it is better to have another disease. Hung-chien sighed and thought that over the past year, his mood has been much older. Only people with strong minds will get this disease. For example, only fat people will have cerebral congestion and stroke, and thin people with anemia and malnutrition are not worthy. If you are more than ten years old, you may fall in love like a fool again when you reach the age of death. I heard that the old man's love is like an old house on fire, and it is hopeless to burn it. It's good, at least comfortable, if it's as plain as it is now and emotions don't become a burden in my heart. Come on, get married. Hsin-mei said Jou-chia had \"taken great pains\", and she thought highly of herself, so she should be more pitied. Hung-chien didn't pay attention. He left her alone for too long and ran back to the hotel. After passing the fruit shop, I bought some fresh litchi and longan.\r\nHung-chien pushed open the door, and the light inside went out, only the light in the corridor came in. He took the door and listened to Jou-chia's silence, thinking that she was asleep. She stepped lightly and wanted to put the fruit on the table. She didn't pay attention to a chair where she was sitting at that time. She left the table alone for a few feet and didn't move back. Knocked over the chair with one foot, hurt the instep and knee, and cursed: \"asshole, who didn't move the chair well!\" \" At the same time, I thought it was bad and woke her up. Jou-chia has been uncomfortable since Hung-chien went, and she is lonely and full of resentment. When he doesn't come, this resentment is like money, which is profitable, just waiting for him to come back and settle accounts. When she heard Hung-chien open the door, she refused to speak first in anger. Hung-chien knocked over the chair, and she laughed out loud, but when she smiled, her anger was released. Fortunately, it was not difficult to hold back. She couldn't make up her mind for a moment: one said that she was eagerly waiting for him to arrive at this time, and the other said that she easily fell asleep and woke him up-which is more justified? Hung-chien turned over the chair, but nothing happened. He became timid. He wanted Jou-chia not to faint and turned on the light.",

Jou-chia slept in the dark for more than an hour, when she suddenly saw the light, she couldn't open her eyes, lifted her eyelids and closed them again, carrying the light sideways and breathing long. Hung-chien was relieved to find that the silk shirt was soaked with sweat. He took off his coat and said with concern, \"I'm sorry to wake you up. Did you sleep well? How do you feel? \"\r\n\"I'm sleepy, so I'll wake you up banging. You sit in this chair by yourself, and you have to curse! \"\r\nShe said these words with her face to the wall. Hung-chien was hanging up his clothes, but he didn't catch them clearly. He turned around and asked, \"What?\" She rolled over and said, \"Alas! I'm so tired that I have to raise my voice to talk to you. I really don't have the energy. Please save my strength-\"But in fact, she raised her voice by a key-\"You moved this chair there. When Hsin-mei arrived, he was like a headhunter sent by the King of Yan, and you didn't care about anything. At this time, I am bold and eccentric. \"\r\nWhen Hung-chien heard the wrong tone, he said apologetically, \"It's my fault. The skin on my leg is scraped a little.\" This \"risks plan\" didn't work. \"I've been out for a long time. Are you really not asleep? Have you eaten? This fresh litchi-\"\r\n\"You also know that go out a good half-day? Anyway, it's up to you to be good friends, eat, drink and be merry, and not come back all night. I died alone in the hotel and no one paid attention to me, \"she said, her voice choked up and she turned back to sleep.\"\r\nHung-chien sat on the edge of the bed in a hurry, stretched out his hand to turn her head around and said, \"I've been out for too long. Please forgive me. Don't be angry. I didn't go out until you taught me to-\"\r\nJou-chia opened his hand and said, \"I'm teaching you not to touch my sweaty hands now. Will you listen to me? Scared, I told you to get out! Aren't you going out on your mind? I can keep you? There's no point in keeping you. You must find fault with me if you stay in the hotel. \"\r\nHung-chien let go and sat angrily in that chair and said, \"It's not the same quarrel now! You want me to stay in the hotel with you. Why didn't you tell the truth at that time? I'm not a worm in your stomach. I know what you're thinking! \"\r\nJou-chia turned around and said at a distance, \"You really love me. I don't need to tell you. Alas! This is reluctant to come. You won't be considerate until I tell you, so forget it! A stranger came with me all the way, saw that I was not feeling well today, and refused to leave me alone for a long time. Hum, you still love me! \"\r\nHung-chien sneered, \"A stranger who is willing to do this to you is already a stranger, at least he is your lover.\"\r\n\"You don't catch my typo, maybe she is a woman? I'd rather be with a woman. You men are all bad people. As long as you coax us into weighing your heart, you don't care. \"\r\nThese words touched Hung-chien's mind. He approached the bed and said, \"All right, stop arguing. If you beat me and drive me out in the future, I won't go out and follow you everywhere.",

Will you listen? \"\r\n\"You say it, it's up to me whether you listen or not-what serious words are you talking about?\" She couldn't help laughing.\r\n\"Will you have children, so your body is so uncomfortable?\"\r\n\"What? Nonsense! \" She replied crisply, \"If you really have a child, I won't spare you! I won't spare you! I don't want children. \"\r\n\"Spare me or not is another matter, and we have to make preparations, so Hsin-mei advised me to get married with you quickly-\"\r\nJou-chia-huo sat up, her eyes wide open and her face turned blue. \"You told Zhao Xinmei about us? You are not human! You are not human! You must blow to him, \"he said, patting the bed hard.\r\nHung-chien stepped back in fear and said, \"Jou-chia, don't get me wrong. Just listen to me-\"\r\n\"I don't want to listen to your explanation. You bully me, I have no face to see anyone since then, you bully me! \" When he said this, he fell down again, his hands pressed his eyes, and his chest shrugged and cried.\r\nHung-chien's heart was not made of raincoat material, but was soaked by her tears. He sat at her head and took her hand, wiping her tears, coaxing and persuading her. She was tired of crying, so she stopped crying and asked him to make it clear. After hearing this, she said in a dumb voice, \"We don't need him to take care of our affairs. He's not my protector. Only if you don't live up to expectations and take his words as an imperial edict, you should listen to him and get married alone. Don't force me. \" Hung-chien said, \"There's no need to talk about these things. I don't listen to him. Everything is up to you-you haven't eaten the litchi I bought for you. Do you want to eat it? Ok, don't move when you are asleep, I'll peel it for you to eat-\"I moved the coffee table and wastebasket closer to the bed-\"I didn't take a bus when I went out today, and I bought it with the car money I saved. Of course, I have the money to buy fruit, but I saved the money to buy it, as if that was what I really gave you. \" Jou-chia's tearful face smiled gently. \"Why save that money? It's no use walking on your own. Saving a few car money is not enough to buy many things. \" Hung-chien said, \"It's not expensive to bargain for. I made a bargain and bought it.\" Jou-chia said, \"You never buy anything. You still think it's cheap when you buy expensive things-eat them yourself, don't give them all to me. \" Hung-chien said, \"Because I can't do it, I'll marry your wife!\"",
        "4918c14c-358f-4012-a15c-f4072f864c15": "Of course, I have the money to buy fruit, but I saved the money to buy it, as if that was what I really gave you. \" Jou-chia's tearful face smiled gently. \"Why save that money?

Friends have to break up. Since you refuse to get married, you don't even have any help. It's really' losing your wife and breaking friends'. \" Jou-chia said, \"Don't talk nonsense. It's getting late, I didn't fall asleep in the afternoon, and I waited for you at night-did my eyes swell from crying? I'm ashamed tomorrow! Give me a mirror. \" Seeing that her eyelids were really swollen, Hung-chien refused to tell the truth. He just said, \"It's just a little swollen. It doesn't matter at all. It will go away after a good sleep-hey, why get up and look in the mirror!\" Jou-chia said, \"I always have to wash my face and rinse my mouth.\" Hung-chien took a shower and went back to his room. Jou-chia had already laid down. Hung-chien asked, \"Did you sleep on the pillow just now? Your tears are all over it. It's very wet and uncomfortable. You sleep on my pillow and your wet pillow lets me sleep. \" Jou-chia said gratefully, \"Silly boy, you don't need to change the pillow. I turned it over and slept on the other side-did it hurt where you scraped your leg? I got up and wrapped it for you. \" When Hung-chien took a bath, his leg was soaked in soapy water, and now the star in the wound hurts, but he said, \"It's healed early, and it doesn't hurt at all. Don't worry, go to sleep. \" Jou-chia said, \"Hung-chien, I'm very worried about what I told you. You can do whatever you want about getting married.\" Hung-chien washed his hair and was combing it. When he heard this, he put down his comb, leaned over and kissed her forehead and said, \"I know you are the most reasonable and obedient.\" Jou-chia sighed happily, turned inward and fell into a deep sleep.\r\nIn the following week, they were so busy that they were driven out of their wits. In the middle of this matter, they remembered what they should do. Cheng Xinmei's relatives tried to help, and there was no problem in registering for marriage. In addition, I wrote to inform my family to ask for money, make a wedding ring, make a new dress, go through the registration formalities, borrow ready-made dresses from the photo studio to take photos, treat people, move to a better hotel, and send photos to my family when I arrive, so as to collect money. Although it was very easy, they spent all the money around them, thanks to the generous gift from Hsin-mei. Hung-chien refused to spend money at first because his job was not settled in the second half of the year and he didn't make any money during the summer vacation. So he advocated not making new clothes, and it was not too good to make new ones. Jou-chia said that she is not a vain and wasteful woman, but the ceremony is only once in her life. She should look like this, and she is as simple as ever. She can wear clothes made of good materials next year. The two men were so busy that they lost their temper and could not help arguing. Jou-chia said angrily, \"I didn't want to get married here. It was your idea. Do you want me to dress up like a Chinese woman that day? There are no friends here, so we have to do everything ourselves, and there are no people to discuss, let alone help! I'm in trouble! There are many people in the family, and there is always a way to make money.",

If we get married in Shanghai, won't your family spend any money? Our engagement has saved a lot of things for our family. \" As an international student, Hung-chien knows about the three-way movement (poor pop payments) popular in the West [2]; Sons usually shout \"independence\", and when it comes to spending money, they force the old man to pay for it. He listened to her and wrote to Fang Tun-weng. Jou-chia read the manuscript of the letter, thinking that the wording was not clear and sincere enough, and asked him to rewrite it. She also said, \"Why are you father and son so polite and not affectionate at all? I can never afford to write to my father! \" He was criticized like a scholar who published his works for the first time, and he was so angry that he would throw a pen and burn the manuscript and refused to write again. Jou-chia said, \"If you don't write, don't write. I don't want your family's money. I will write to my father.\" When she finished writing the letter, she asked him if he wanted to censor it. He took it over and read it. Sure enough, the tone was affectionate, and the words \"Dad\" and \"Mom\" on the paper were as good as heard. As a result, he also sent the letter without showing it to Jou-chia. Later, she realized that it was a false alarm, and complained that Hung-chien had always listened to Hsin-mei's advice and married so hastily, which only aroused suspicion at home. But the letter from home was sent out early, and everything was ready, so it could not be cancelled temporarily. A few days after marriage, I look forward to hearing from home every day, which is far less carefree than when I was in Guilin. The Fang family and the Sun family wired money one after another, and Hsin-mei booked the boat tickets back to Shanghai for them. Mrs.Zhao has also arrived in Hong Kong and will fly to Chongqing in a few days. Two days before sailing, Mr.and Mrs.Hung-chien went up the mountain to see Hsin-mei. First, they met Mrs.Zhao; second, they saw her off; third, they said goodbye; and fourth, they paid the bill for the boat tickets.\r\nThey went to the relatives' home where Hsin-mei lived and sent in their business cards. Hsin-mei ran out, followed by the doorman. Hsin-mei's mouth is full of \"it's not worthwhile for your wife to work hard.\" Jou-chia smiled and protested, \"Uncle Zhao, don't call me that. I can't afford it.\" Hsin-mei said, \"That doesn't make sense-Hung-chien, you've come at an unfortunate time. Su Wenwan is inside. She has been in Hong Kong for two days, knowing that my mother is coming, and just came to see her today. You may not want to see Su Wenwan, so I rushed out to say hello to you. However, she knows that you are outside. \" Hung-chien blushed, looked at Jou-chia and said, \"Then let's not go in. Just ask Hsin-mei to tell the old aunt for us. Hsin-mei, I'll give you back the money for the boat ticket. \" Hsin-mei was just refusing, when Jou-chia said, \"Since I'm here, I'm sure I'll meet my old aunt-\"She came in new clothes today, full of courage and a little curious. Although Hung-chien was afraid of meeting Su Wenwan, he also aroused his curiosity.",

Although Hung-chien was afraid of meeting Su Wenwan, he also aroused his curiosity. Hsin-mei led them in. Before entering the drawing room, when Hung-chien hung the straw hat on the shelf, Jou-chia opened her handbag and looked in the mirror.\r\nSu Wenwan is more fashionable than last year, and her face is much plump. Cheongsam mixed with western style, which is tight and smart. The pattern on the robe is light red and light green with white stripes between the stripes, and the flowers are like the flags of small countries on the European continent. There is a big straw hat with a wide edge on the coffee table at hand, which is hers of course, making Jou-chia's small parasol out of date. As soon as Hung-chien entered the door, he bowed deeply from afar. Mrs.Zhao stood up to greet her, and Wen Wan 'an sat down and said briskly, \"Mr.Fang, long time no see. How are you?\" Hsin-mei said, \"This is Mrs.Fang.\" Wen Wan had seen Jou-chia long ago, and now it seemed as if she had only discovered her after listening to Hsin-mei's words. When nodding to her, she glanced from head to toe. Jou-chia couldn't stand her looking at it like this, and she was embarrassed. Wen Wan asked Hsin-mei, \"Is this Mrs.Fang still that bank? Money house? Alas! I have a bad memory-the manager's lady? \" Hung-chien and his wife all heard clearly, and their faces turned red at the same time, but it was inconvenient to reply, because Wen Wan's voice seemed too low for them to hear. Hsin-mei didn't understand for a moment, but said, \"This is the young lady of one of my colleagues. She got married in Hong Kong last week.\" Wen Wan felt like a dream, surprised and sighed, \"So it's another Mrs.Fang. Have you always been in Hong Kong, or did you come back from a foreign country and pass through Hong Kong this time?\" Hung-chien clung to the armrest of the chair to prevent himself from jumping up. Hsin-mei shook his head secretly. Jou-chia can only admit that it is not imported from foreign countries, but exported from the mainland. Wen Wan's interest in her suddenly disappeared, and she continued to talk to Mrs.Zhao about their words. Mrs.Zhao said that it was the first time in her life that she flew by plane, and she was afraid when she expected it. Wen Wan said with a smile, \"Auntie, you have Hsin-mei to accompany you. What are you afraid of? I flew around five or six times alone. \" Mrs.Zhao said, \"How can your husband rest assured that you will come and go alone?\" Wen Wan said, \"He can't get away from business here! He flew to Chongqing with me twice. The first time he just got married and went to see my father-he was going to visit my aunt with me today, so I took him to see Hsin-mei. \"Hsin-mei said,\" I'm flattered. I met Mr.Cao on your wedding day. He is not fatter now, is he? He seems to be a head shorter than me, and he is easy to get fat. It doesn't matter in Hong Kong. If in Chongqing, the civil servant who manages materials and food gets fat, people will make fun of him. \" Hung-chien came to laugh for the first time today, and Wen Wan turned slightly red. Before she could speak, Mrs.Zhao said, \"Hsin-mei, you are a child in your thirties, and you still love to talk nonsense.",

Miss Wen Wan, a mother always thinks that her son is not fat enough. You look great. My eyes are comfortable looking at you. Your old lady will like it when she sees you. Go back and say hello to Mr.Cao for us. He is busy with business, so don't bother. \" Wen Wan said, \"It doesn't matter if he doesn't come to the office for half a day occasionally. But today he also asked for leave from the office and got drunk yesterday. \" Mrs.Zhao said grandly, \"Wine is very harmful. You should advise him to drink less in the future.\" Wen Wan glanced over Hsin-mei's face and replied, \"He won't drink it, unlike Hsin-mei, and it's just a bottle for Weiss to avoid.\" Hearing the last sentence, Hsin-mei made a face at Hung-chien secretly, and it was too late to protest the next sentence. \"He was drunk. Yesterday, people from our college classmates who worked here had a dinner party, and the post stated' bring your family'; He is my' family'. I took him and he was drunk. \" Hung-chien couldn't help asking, \"How many people in our class are in Hong Kong?\" Wen Wan said, \"Yo! Mr.Fang, I forgot that you are also in our class. They didn't post to you, did they? Yesterday, only I was a liberal arts student, and the rest were students of science, engineering, law and business. \" Hsin-mei said, \"Look, how proud you are! At present, only those who study science, technology and business are lucky, while those who study liberal arts are too poor to face people and dare not agree with learning. Thanks to you, support the scene of liberal arts. \" Wen Wan said, \"I don't believe the old classmates are so snobbish-aren't you a law student? If you want to talk about luck, you are also lucky, \"he said with a triumphant smile. Hsin-mei said, \"I'm far behind your Mr.Cao. The class reunion is held by people who have had enough to eat and have nothing to do, holding hands with rich students. When you see a dissatisfied classmate, you ask' where do you work', and without waiting for an answer, you stretch your ears to listen to the conversation of the rich classmate. When I was a student, having a get-together had a social function for men and women. When I was in the United States, people called the summer meeting for international students a' three-headed meeting': showing off, taking the blame, and-er-lovers making flowers-\"Everyone laughed, and Mrs.Zhao choked with laughter, and Hsin-mei was not allowed to talk nonsense. Wen Wan smiled shorter than others, and said, \"You participated in the Summer Festival yourself. Don't blame me. I have seen that photo. What are you?\" Hsin-mei couldn't answer. Wen Wan clapped her hands and said, \"Good! You can't say it. Aunt, I don't think Hsin-mei is as honest as before recently, and his mind is much smaller. I'm afraid the friends he has made this year have something to do with it. \"Jou-chia stared at Hung-chien, and Hung-chien clung to the arm of the chair.\" Aunt, I won't send you to the plane tomorrow, but I will meet you in Chongqing next month. I'll send a packet of small things back to the servant.",

If it's not convenient for aunt to bring it, let him bring the original thing. \" She stood up and raised the tassel of a big straw hat, as if the Greek goddess of hunting was carrying a shield and told Zhao Lao.Don't send it, so he said to Hsin-mei, \"I'll punish you. I'll punish you for taking those two cartons for me and taking me to the door.\" Hsin-mei saw Hung-chien and his wife standing, in case she ignored them rudely, and said, \"Mr.Fang and Mrs.Fang are also looking after you.\" Wen Wan nodded to Hung-chien and held out his hand to let Jou-chia pull it, as if he had put his finger in hot water to see if it was hot. His face looked like he was holding hands with someone who was a head taller than Jou-chia, and his eyes surpassed Jou-chia's head. Then she said affectionately, \"Goodbye, Auntie,\" and looked at Hsin-mei with a look of joy and anger. Hsin-mei quickly hugged the box and went out with her.\r\nMr.and Mrs.Hung-chien perfunctory with Mrs.Zhao, and when Hsin-mei came in, they got up and said goodbye. Mrs.Zhao asked them to sit for a while, complaining about Hsin-mei. \"You are a stupid child again. Why bother to hurt her husband?\" Hung-chien thought to himself that Su Wenwan might be complacent, thinking that Hsin-mei had failed to forget his feelings and be jealous. Hsin-mei said, \"Don't worry, she will never be angry, as long as we bring smuggled goods for her.\" Hsin-mei wanted to see them off to the station. When he went out, he said, \"Su Wenwan is outrageous today. He was very rude to you.\" Hung-chien pretended to be open-minded and said, \"Nothing. She's a rich lady and a rich wife, and she should have some air-\"He didn't pay attention to Jou-chia's look at him-\"What did you mean by' bringing contraband'? \" Hsin-mei said, \"Every time she flies to Chongqing, she always brings some new cosmetics, medicines, high-heeled shoes, fountain pens and so on to others. Maybe she sells them for money. I don't know.\" Hung-chien was so surprised that he cried out, only to know that swinging high in this blue sky is not where God and heaven belong, but only for the convenience of dropping bombs and going solo, and he said, \"Strange! I can't believe it! Does she still want to do business? I thought only people like Li Meiting brought contraband! Isn't she a poetess Do you still do vernacular poems? \" Hsin-mei said with a smile, \"I don't know. She really knows how to broker! She just advised my mother to buy foreign exchange quickly. I think women are all calculating. \" Jou-chia kept a calm face and pretended not to hear. Hung-chien said, \"I'm talking nonsense. She seems to be very-uh-very close to you.\" Hsin-mei blushed and said, \"She knows I'm in Chongqing, too, and she always calls me every time she comes. She is only nicer to me now than before she got married. \" Hung-chien got cold air in his nose and wanted to say, \"No wonder you need a protective photo,\" but he didn't say it.",

Hsin-mei paused, looked into the distance, and said, \"I saw her out just now, and she said that she still kept a lot of my letters there-I forgot all those letters, and I didn't know what was written on them-and she said that she would come to Chongqing next month and bring them back to me. However, she refused to return all the letters to me. She said that she could still accept some of them now. She wants to check one letter at a time in front of me and return the letters she can't accept now. Are you ridiculous? \" Say that finish, smile unnaturally. Jou-chia asked calmly, \"She doesn't know that Uncle Zhao is getting engaged, does she?\" Hsin-mei said, \"I didn't tell her. I was very general about her.\" Seeing Mr.and Mrs.Hung-chien on the cable car down the mountain, on the way home, Hsin-mei suddenly understood and sighed, \"Only women can see through women.\"\r\nHung-chien got on the bus sullenly. He knew that he had been sorry for Su Wenwan in the past, and he should be snubbed by her today. What was exasperating was that Jou-chia was also bullied. Why didn't you satirize Su Wenwan at that time, but bowed your head and endured her arrogance? I'm sorry to think about it afterwards. However, being left out by her is second, but the comparison between the past and the present makes people sad. Two years ago, no, a year ago, she was completely equal. Now, she's on top, and she's a far cry from her position. Just like Hsin-mei, he thinks highly of himself as a friend, but he is also climbing up step by step, and he wants to admire him himself, unlike before. Hung-chien Yu Bo felt like a wild animal in a dark room, hitting, scratching and beating the wall desperately, but he couldn't find a way out. Jou-chia saw that he didn't speak, but refrained from speaking. Back at the hotel, the waiter opened the door. Hung-chien took off his coat and turned on the electric fan. He opened his arms and said, \"Come back, alas!\"\r\n\"The body is back, and I'm afraid the soul has been taken away by my lover,\" Jou-chia added two comments without expression.\r\nOf course, Hung-chien called her \"nonsense\". She sneered, \"I don't talk nonsense.\" On the cable car, just like Woodenhead, I didn't say a word, forgetting that I was next to me. I am very interested and will never bother you, see when you talk to me. \"\r\n\"Now I'm not talking to you? I'm not angry about what happened today-\"\r\n\"How can you be angry? You only have satisfaction. \"\r\n\"That's not necessarily true. What am I satisfied with?\"\r\n\"It's not satisfying to see your former lover spoil your present wife in front of your good friend!\" Jou-chia gave up her sarcastic tone and said frankly with resentment, \"I told you, I don't like to associate with Zhao Xinmei. But what's the use of what I said? Dare I say' no' if you want to go? Go to the people look down upon, give people laugh-\"\r\n\"You are so unreasonable. Aren't you going in yourself? Blame it on me afterwards? And the somebody else didn't spoil you, he left to hold hands with you-\"\r\nJou-chia was furious and smiled, \"I'm so honored! When Mrs.Chenggui's jade hand touched me, my cheap hand will smell sweet all my life, and I dare not wash it from now on!",
        "153b285d-7224-4322-baf8-9d629364c41a": "\"That's not necessarily true.

Hum, if someone hits me on the head, you will seem not to see it. Anyway, my wife should be bullied by wild women. When I saw my husband being laughed at, I couldn't bear it. I felt that my face had been stripped. She said that Hsin-mei's friends were not good, didn't she mean you? \"\r\n\"Let her go to scold. I want to pay her back a few words, and she can't stand it. \"\r\n\"Why don't you pay her back?\"\r\n\"Why dispute with her? I just think she is ridiculous. \"\r\n\"Good magnanimous! Your good temper and great measure, why don't you stay at home and enjoy it for me? See the outsiders, bow their heads and smile apologetically; Go home to me, a word is not speculative, just turn against each other and quarrel. People see Fang Hung-chien as polite and patient. I don't know how angry I am with you. I'm the only one. If you were that expensive lady, you'd be angry with her. \"She gave a meal and said,\" Of course, if you marry such a good wife, you won't lose your temper. \"\r\nPart of what she said is true, plus a lot of seasoning. Unable to reply, Hung-chien looked out of the window angrily. Jou-chia, seeing that he couldn't speak, thought that the last sentence had stung him. She was so jealous that she fidgeted and controlled the excitement in her voice. She sneered and said to herself, \"I'm broken. It's all bragging. It's all bragging.\"\r\nHung-chien turned around and asked, \"Who is bragging?\"\r\n\"You ah. You said how much she loved you and wanted to marry you. Today, she is obviously dating Zhao Xinmei, and she didn't even look at you. It was you who pursued her and didn't catch up! Men all blow like this. \" Hung-chien couldn't disprove this kind of \"ancient history debate\" theory, so he could only say repeatedly, \"Even if I brag, you can see through it, even if I brag.\" Jou-chia said, \"How nice she is! Beautiful, my father is rich, rich, and a female student abroad. If I were you, and she didn't like me, I would beg on my knees, not to mention that she actually liked me-\"Hung-chien's eyes were red and he rudely cut her off:\" Yes! Yes! People really don't want me. However, there are actually women like you who try their best to marry me. \" Jou-chia opened her eyes wide, and her lower lip could bite a blood stain. She said in a trembling voice, \"I'm blind! I am blind! \"\r\nIn the next four or five hours, Jou-chia did not become blind, but both of them became dumb, eating and doing things, and neither ignored the other. Hung-chien knew that he had spoken too hard and regretted it, but he was unwilling to give in for a while. In the afternoon, it suddenly occurred to him that he would go to the shipping company tomorrow to get the ticket with a receipt. Hsin-mei gave it to himself the day before yesterday, but he forgot where it was and refused to ask Jou-chia. I was busy rummaging through the box and reaching for my pocket, but I couldn't find the receipt. I was so anxious that I was sweating all over like a wave in the Yangtze River, and the waves rolled up again. Jou-chia saw him scratching his sweaty hair and touching his red ears. \"What are you looking for?\"",

Is it a receipt from the shipping company? \" Hung-chien looked at her in horror, hoping for an epiphany, and said kindly, \"How did you guess? Did you see it? \" Jou-chia said, \"You put it in the pocket of that white suit-\"Hung-chien stamped his foot and said, \"Damn it! I gave that suit to the waiter for dry cleaning yesterday. What should I do? I'm going to get out. \" Jou-chia opened her handbag and said, \"Take out the clothes and wash them, and give them to the waiter without taking care of them first! Fortunately, I checked it out for you, and there is still a rotten bill. \" Hung-chien was so grateful that he said, \"Thank you, thank you-\"Jou-chia said, \"How easy it is to marry a husband like you by all means, and dare to wait on you carelessly?\" When I spoke, my eyes were slightly red. Hung-chien bowed to the arch, admitting that he was not, and wanted to take her out to eat ice. Jou-chia said, \"I'm not a child. Don't coax me into eating. I will never forget the words' do everything possible' until I die. \" Hung-chien put his hand on her mouth to stop her from sighing. As a result, Jou-chia accompanied him out to eat ice. Jou-chia sucked orange juice and asked Su Wenwan if she used to dress like that. Hung-chien said, \"My grandmother is thirty years old, and her clothes are getting more and more colorful. Everyone has to snigger. I think she is far less lovely than you.\" Jou-chia shook her head and smiled, indicating that she couldn't believe it and was willing to believe her husband's words. Hung-chien said, \"Listen to Hsin-mei's talk about how vulgar she has become now. I don't know where she used to be. I didn't expect that in a year, she would become mercenary and not like a lady.\" Jou-chia said, \"Maybe she hasn't changed. Her father knows what kind of corrupt official she is, and her daughter is of course hereditary. Her nature has always been lurking in it. Now that she has married someone and her psychological development is complete, her true colors are revealed. Vulgar doesn't matter, I think she is too cheap. When you have a husband, you have to hook up with Hsin-mei. What a good family! Little wife's daughter, I guess. An ugly and poor wife like me, although annoying to you, will be quiet and won't show your ugliness; If you marry that young lady, you won't be able to keep an outer room for Zhao Xinmei. \" Hung-chien knew that what she said was too mean, so he had to go along with it. So humiliate Su Wenwan, they made up.\r\nThis quarrel is like a storm in summer. When it is noisy, it is very serious and passes quickly. However, from then on, they all saved their hearts, controlled themselves and avoided speaking conflicts. On the first night of the ship, they enjoyed the cool air on the deck. Hung-chien said, \"Last year, we went to the mainland on the same boat for the first time. Unexpectedly, we came back on the same boat this year, and we are already husband and wife.\" Jou-chia took his hand instead of answering.

I thought you were a good person, but who knows you are the worst bad person. \" Hung-chien took her hand instead of answering. Jou-chia asked what day it was in August, and Hung-chien said the second. Jou-chia sighed, \"In five days, it will be the first anniversary!\" When Hung-chien asked about the first anniversary, Jou-chia was disappointed and said, \"How could you forget! Didn't we meet Zhao Xinmei on the morning of August 7 last year? \" Hung-chien was more ashamed than forgetting National Day and National Shame Day, and said quickly, \"I remember. I remember all the clothes you wore that day. \" Jou-chia said soothingly, \"I wore a blue and white dress that day, didn't I?\" I don't remember what you looked like that day. I didn't leave an impression, but of course I remember that day. Is this the so-called' fate', when two strangers meet by chance and slowly get better? \" Hung-chien commented, \"For example, many of us in the same boat this time don't know anyone. I don't know where they came from, so why don't you take this boat first and then, thinking that it was accidental to get together with them this time. If we are familiar with their situation and purpose, we will know that it is no accident that they took this boat, and there are reasons why they have to take it, just like us. It's like turning on the radio. You turn the needle around on the surface, and you hear half a sentence of Peking Opera from a radio station in the east and half a sentence of report from a radio station in the west. Suddenly, it's half a sentence of foreign songs, half a sentence of Kunqu opera and pieces of chicken and dog, all of which are puzzling. But every broken fragment, in the program broadcast by its own radio station, has the above and below, which is not nonsense. As long as you identify a radio station and listen, you will understand its meaning. We communicate with each other in the same way, strangers who don't know each other very well-\"Jou-chia yawned a square inch. Like everyone else, Hung-chien hates people yawning when listening to himself. The experience of hypnosis in disguise in class over the past year has increased his hatred, and he immediately shut up. Jou-chia apologized, \"I'm tired. Go on.\" Hung-chien said, \"Go to sleep when you are tired. I won't talk about it.\" Jou-chia complained, \"Let's talk about the two of us. Why do we have to involve the whole ship, the whole human race?\" Hung-chien said bitterly, \"When you talk to women, you only talk about yourselves, and you know nothing else! Go to sleep first, I have to sit down for a while. \" Jou-chia left with a pretense of indifference. Hung-chien smoked a cigarette, calmed down and began to feel ridiculous.

Why do we have to involve the whole ship, the whole human race?\" Hung-chien said bitterly, \"When you talk to women, you only talk about yourselves, and you know nothing else! Go to sleep first, I have to sit down for a while. \" Jou-chia left with a pretense of indifference. Hung-chien smoked a cigarette, calmed down and began to feel ridiculous. That talk was really like a speech on the stage; I have been teaching for less than a year, but this habit has been formed. I should pay attention to correcting myself in the future. No wonder Lu Zixiao has been a professor for many years, and proposing marriage is like testing students. However, Jou-chia is too headstrong. She often blames herself for talking to others, but when she comes back, she has nothing to say to her. Today, after a long talk with her, she yawned again, and her letters from home praised her for being submissive!\r\nHung-chien has been afraid of being near home these two days and has a lot on his mind. He feels that going home is not as simple as ideal. Far from being equal to temporary death, at least you become strange. Going home is just like returning half-baked things to the pot. It takes a while to cook them. Taking Jou-chia back this time will take a lot of time to adapt to the family. He is so upset that he is afraid to go to sleep-sleep is a strange thing. If you don't want it, it will come, invite it, coax it, and try every means to seduce it. It hides its identity and disappears. Instead of tossing and turning on a hot pillow, sit on the deck. Jou-chia waited for her husband to make peace, and when he didn't come for a long time, she packed up her grievances and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Too weak. At the mercy of lust-the next sentence is an idiom.\r\n[2] Poor dad pays the bills for the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnine\r\n\r\n\r\nHung-chien praised his wife's pliancy in a letter from home reporting her engagement. After reading the letter, Fang Tun-weng screamed like a hen laid an egg, and the whole family knew the news within a minute. The old couple were amazed, followed by chagrin. Mrs.Fang especially blames her son for his recklessness, why she got engaged without asking her parents' permission first. Tun-Weng said, \"We have done our duty as parents and climbed the Zhou family's daughter for him. This time he is the master himself, no matter how good it is, he will not blame his parents for the bad. Why do you care about them? \" Mrs.Fang said, \"I don't know what that Miss Sun looks like. Hung-chien is so confused that he doesn't send a photo!\" Tun-Weng asked his second daughter-in-law for a letter and said, \"He said in her letter that she was' gentle'.\" Like all people with low education, Mrs.Fang is superstitious about the black words written on white paper, but she has a question of human geography: \"Is she a mainlander?\" The temper of mainlanders is always a bit rough, and they don't get along with us. \" Second Daughter-in-law said, \"Not from other provinces, but from other counties.\" Tun-Weng said, \"As long as Hung-chien thinks she is submissive, it will be fine. Alas, now daughter-in-law, do you still want her to be filial to you? This won't happen. \" Second grandma and third grandma winked at each other, and the happy expression on their faces converged at the same time. Mrs.Fang said, \"I wonder if the Sun family has any money?\" Tun-Weng said with a smile, \"Her father works in a newspaper office, and people in the newspaper office will rip him off. He should be rich, hehe! I think the boss, the child, is blessed with idiots. The Zhou family who got engaged for the first time was very rich, and later took a fancy to Su Hongye's daughter, who was also a rich and powerful family.",

In any case, this young lady graduated from college and works outside. It seems that she can stand on her own feet. \" Tun Weng's words inadvertently made two enemies for Jou-chia; The second and third grandmothers' families are in a normal situation. They only studied in middle school.\r\nHung-chien wrote in Hong Kong to report his marriage and asked his father to send money. Tun-Weng was surprised and angry after reading it, and immediately became very silent. He shut the door with Mrs.Fang and studied the letter for a long time. Mrs.Fang blamed Jou-chia for seducing her son, and Tun-weng also made disrespectful comments on free love and new women. But he is the head of the family. If anyone in the family is ashamed, he is ashamed of himself. His dirty laundry can't be publicized outside, and it can't be publicized inside. He has to hide it for his eldest son and daughter-in-law between their brothers and sisters. He told Mrs.Fang not to mention this to the second daughter-in-law and the third daughter-in-law, and sighed, \"Children are really bad debts, so you have to worry about them all your life. Mom, why are you angry? They also know that they want to get married, and that's it. \" At dinner, Tun-Weng smiled quite naturally and said, \"There is a letter from the boss today. They have arrived in Hong Kong. Some of my friends who went with me want to get married in Hong Kong. The boss is jealous and wants to hold a wedding with Miss Sun at the same time. Young people are always rushing to do things and like to join in the fun. He also said in his letter that he would save my money and my business. This is also his sympathy for us, Mom, isn't it? \" When everyone was amazed, he went on to say, \"I paid all the expenses for Peng Tufeng's marriage. Now I have to get married in the same ostentation and extravagance as I used to do in my hometown. I can't afford it. Hung-chien saved me money, so why not? However, Pengtu, you will wire him a sum of money for me tomorrow, indicating that I treat you three brothers equally, so as not to blame your parents for being unfair in the future. \" After dinner, when Tun Weng sat down, he said, \"This is a very good idea. Whenever they get married, the two parties don't care, but others help them. If he gets married in Shanghai, it goes without saying that my mother and I, even your husband and wife, will be very busy. Now everyone is convenient. \" He is confident that these words will make it clear that his sons and daughters-in-law will not be suspicious. He wrote in his diary that day: \"It's coming to Hong Kong, and Yun will finish his marriage with Ms. Sun Roujia in Hong Kong, so he will save money and save trouble. Its meaning is commendable, and it is a matter of sending money. \" Third Daughter-in-law was washing her face when Second Daughter-in-law came and whispered, \"Did you hear that? I don't think this is good. Can't you wait for the three or four days from Hong Kong to Shanghai? \" Third Daughter-in-law didn't want to lose to her. She said, \"They suddenly got engaged in the Mainland. I thought it was too abrupt at that time. There was something wrong with it.\" Second daughter-in-law said, \"That's right! I thought so at that time. In what month did they get engaged? \" Two people only calculated and smiled at each other.",

Second Daughter-in-law smiled and said, \"Uncle, I'm afraid our eldest sister-in-law is a record-breaker among Fang's daughter-in-law.\"\r\nA few days later, the wedding photos arrived. Jou-chia's face was almost her ideal face. Tun-weng liked it, and Mrs.Fang put on her working glasses several times and three times to look closely. Feng Yi said to his wife privately, \"Sun Roujia is still beautiful, much better than the dead Zhou's daughter.\" Third Daughter-in-law sneered, \"You can't rely on photos. You have to meet them to be accurate. Some people take pictures, some people don't, and ugly people often take good pictures. Don't be fooled. Why only take a bust? It must be that the whole body can't be photographed, and the gauze and flowers can't be covered. I bet you. Scare! I was married by your family, and now it's bad luck to call such a woman' big sister-in-law'! I'm really unwilling. You see, this is a college graduate! \" Second Daughter-in-law expressed her feelings to her husband as follows: \"Did you pay attention? Sun Roujia's face is full of evil spirits. She looks like an evil woman at first glance, so she will do that shameless thing. Your father and mother are a pair of old fools, but praise her beauty! It's not that I'm bragging. My sisters are more or less honest and clean, not to mention never having a boyfriend, or being engaged, and it's not allowed to correspond with my fiance. \" Peng Tu said, \"Boss, I'm afraid this Yue family is not as good as last week's. Zhou Houqing is good at speculation and business. His gold and silver shops are very developed, and the boss fell out with him. What a fool! I met Zhou Houqing's son the day before yesterday. He used to study with the boss. He is seventeen or eighteen years old. He has already worked as an assistant in a gold and silver shop and can drive a car. I want to make friends with his father, restore the relationship between Zhou and Fang, and we can invest together in the future. Don't let this out. \"\r\nJou-chia didn't want to go to her husband's house as soon as she got off the boat. She had to go back to her mother's house first. Hung-chien understood her fear of strangers and was not forced. He knew that there was no room for himself at home, and the room he lived in after leaving the Zhou family was dark and narrow, so he could only put a small bed. Jou-chia also stated that she would not be a daughter-in-law in a big family. For the time being, they both live in their own homes while looking for a house. They went ashore, paid the patrol detectives who kept the peace in the Shanghai Concession of the Great French Republic, and redeemed their luggage. Hung-chien sent his wife to Sun's house first. Because the bus is waiting, money is counted every second, and the etiquette of seeing the parents-in-law is simple to the extreme. He went home alone, and Fang Tunweng and his wife were very unhappy when they saw that the bride didn't come with him. At the same time, they were relieved: the hut where Hung-chien lived was now sleeping for two old ladies, but it hasn't been let out. The bride really came, and there is no room to change clothes.",

The old couple asked their son many questions about the bride's career in the second half of the year. Hung-chien put on a show and said that the newspaper asked him to be the director of the reference room. Tun-Weng said, \"So, you will live in Shanghai for a long time. It's very crowded at home, and it takes my heart to find a house nearby for you. Hey! \" Hung-chien couldn't speak until his closest relatives thanked him. Tun-Weng sent his son to invite Jou-chia for lunch tomorrow evening, and asked her husband-in-law when it would be convenient for him to choose a hotel and invite his in-laws. He was conceited and proficient in the world, and laughed at the old lady and said, \"According to the old-fashioned way of getting married, the bride was brought here in a sedan chair, regardless of her fear of life. I can't do it now. I want to ask my second or third grandmother to accompany the boss to Sun's house to invite her and welcome her. In this way, she can be less unfamiliar. \" Third Daughter-in-law kept a calm face, while Second Daughter-in-law laughed and said, \"Great! We are going to welcome the eldest sister-in-law I'll accompany you tomorrow, big brother. \" Hung-chien hurriedly declined. After the separation, Third Daughter-in-law said to Second Daughter-in-law, \"Sister, you are really good-tempered! What is Sun Roujia, putting on airs and asking us to meet her! I won't. \" Second Daughter-in-law said, \"She won't come if she refuses to come today. I guess she is going to give birth soon, and she has no face to come to her in-laws' house. Let's just wait for Shuangxi to come in. I know the boss will never let me go. You see how worried he was at that time. \" Third Daughter-in-law was ashamed of herself and said, \"Although the eldest son is the eldest son, the eldest grandson of the Fang family is always a disgrace to you. It is useless for Sun Roujia to have a son quickly. \" Second Daughter-in-law pointed at her and said, \"Yo! What can we share in their family? Do we still talk about the eldest son and grandson these days? Ah Ch 'ou is not the same grandson as your Ah Hsiung. The old man's money is running out, and the usual income from the field is now empty. The boss will not stick to his family for three or four months. I think the old man will support his family in the future. \" Third Daughter-in-law sighed, \"Their parents' hearts are all in the armpit! Boss spent a lot of money studying abroad after graduating from college, and now he still needs the old man's money. I don't understand what's the use of him staying abroad, not to mention that he can't compare with his second brother, and he is worse than our third child. \" Second Daughter-in-law said, \"Let's see female college students' independence.\" The two of them were as affectionate as sworn sisters (because their biological sisters were jealous of each other), and Sun Roujia never dreamed that she was a peace messenger between sisters-in-law.\r\nAfter lunch, Tun Weng took a nap, and the old lady took two unwilling old maids to make room, while the second and third grandmothers slept with the children. Ah Ch 'ou and Ah Hsiung were left unattended, so they went to the living room to haunt Hung-chien. Ah Ch 'ou asked his uncle to show his aunt, and playfully asked, \"Uncle, who is Sun Roujia?\"",

Ah Ch 'ou asked his uncle to show his aunt, and playfully asked, \"Uncle, who is Sun Roujia?\" A fierce stood a few steps away from Hung-chien, just eating his fingers. Hearing this, he pulled out his fingers and said with a sharp tongue, \"You can't say' Sun Roujia', but say' Auntie'. Uncle, I didn't say' Sun Roujia'. \" Hung-chien said absently, \"Hello.\" Ah Ch 'ou invited a wedding banquet, and Hung-chien said, \"Don't make any noise, grandpa will give it to you tomorrow.\" Ah Ch 'ou said, \"Then give me a piece of candy now.\" Hung-chien said, \"You just had dinner. What kind of candy did you eat? You don't have a fierce brother. \" Ah Xiong pulled out his finger again and said, \"I want to eat a piece of candy, too.\" Hung-chien shook his head and said, \"I hate it. There is no sugar to eat.\" Ah Ch 'ou climbed onto the table by the window and looked at the pedestrians in the street. Ah Ch 'ou was too young to climb, so he asked his uncle to carry him up. Hung-chien was busy with the accounts and ignored him, so he looked sad and cried for a pee. Hung-chien, who had never been a father, put down his pencil and said, \"You held your breath. I'll help you go upstairs to find Zhang Ma, but don't come down again when you go upstairs. \" Ah hsiung didn't want to go up and pointed to the spittoon beside the table. Hung-chien said, \"Suit yourself.\" Ah Ch 'ou turned around and said, \"A man just passed by. He had a popsicle in one hand. He had two popsicles, one licked and the other licked. Uncle, he has two popsicles. \" Ah Xiong forgot to pee and said, \"I want to see that man, too. Let me go up and see it.\" Ah Ch 'ou proudly said, \"He's gone somewhere. You can't see him-Uncle, have you ever eaten popsicles?\" Ah Xiong said honestly, \"I want to eat popsicles.\" Ah Ch 'ou jumped down from the table and said honestly, \"I want to eat popsicles.\" Hung-chien said that when Zhang Ma or Sun Ma cleaned up the room and sent her to buy it, it was not allowed to make any noise at this time, and whoever made any noise would be fined the ice. Ah Ch 'ou asked how long it would take to clean the room. Hung-chien said, wait at least half an hour. Ah Ch 'ou said, \"I'm not noisy. I'll watch you write.\" Ah Xiong has had enough of the index finger of his right hand, so he changes the ring finger of his left hand to try something new. Hung-chien couldn't write ten words. Ah Ch 'ou asked, \"Uncle, has it been half an hour?\" Hung-chien said impatiently, \"Nonsense, it's early!\" Ah Ch 'ou endured for a while and said, \"Uncle, this pencil of yours is very beautiful. You let me write a word. \" Hung-chien knew that when he got the pencil, he would be executed and beheaded, and refused to give it to him. Ah Ch 'ou looked around in the living room and found a pencil half an inch long, an old invitation card. He sucked the pencil tip in his mouth and penetrated the back of the paper, writing the word \"big\" and \"square\" like a match. Hung-chien said, \"OK, OK. Go up and see if Zhang Ma has packed up. \" Ah Ch 'ou went down and said he hadn't.",

Ah Ch 'ou asked, \"Are you related to your aunt at school?\" Hung-chien struck the table and jumped up and said, \"What? Who taught you to say such things? \" Ah Ch 'ou blushed more than Hung-chien, and said, \"I-I heard what my mother said to my father.\" Hung-chien said resentfully, \"Your mother is an asshole! You have no ice to eat, punish your ice! \" Seeing that Hung-chien was serious, Ah Ch 'ou knew that the ice wouldn't reach his mouth. He made a mental victory and retreated to a safer distance. He said, \"I don't want your ice, but my mother will buy it for me. Big uncle is the worst, bad big uncle! Dead uncle! \" Hung-chien put on airs and said, \"If you talk nonsense again, I'll hit you.\" Ah Ch 'ou cocked his head and puffed his mouth to show his stubbornness. Ah Xiong approached the table and said, \"Uncle, I'm good. I didn't say anything.\" Hung-chien said, \"You have something to eat with ice. Don't be like him! \" Hearing that Ah Hsiung still had ice to eat, Ah Ch 'ou came up and grabbed his arm with one hand and spread his palm with the other, saying, \"You lost my ball yesterday. Give it to me quickly. I want my ball, so I'll shoot it at this time.\" Ah Xiong was so scared that he asked the big uncle to help him out. When Hung-chien pulled Ah Ch 'ou, Ah Ch 'ou slapped Ah Hsiung, who cried and peed all over the floor. Hung-chien was scolding Ah Ch 'ou when Second Daughter came down and scolded, \"You woke up my little brother!\" Third Daughter-in-law rushed down when she heard her son crying. Both children were pulled up by their mothers, and Ah Ch 'ou argued all the way: \"Why did uncle give him ice instead of me?\" Hung-chien took out his handkerchief to wipe his sweat and sighed. Think about how Jou-chia can get used to living in such a family. I can't believe that my brother and daughter-in-law are such a waste of people behind their backs. Of course, they still have many ugly words, and they simply don't want to know them. Ah Ch 'ou regrets that sentence now. I have always forgotten my family habits, and I don't think it contains much hatred and meanness.

I have been doing things in society for more than 30 years.

I don't understand, I won't go. \" Hung-chien said, \"Today is to get to know each other. There is no etiquette, but my father wants us to pay a tribute to our ancestors.\" Jou-chia said coquetry, \"Your family has ancestors. We fell from the sky and have no ancestors! Why don't you salute the ancestors of our Sun family? Tomorrow I will teach my father to punish you for taking photos of your grandparents. I want revenge! \" Hearing her loose tone, Hung-chien said apologetically, \"Look at me and be wronged.\" Jou-chia said, \"If it's not for you, I really don't want to go today. I'm not a new puppy or kitten. I need someone to hold me and worship the stove! \" When she arrived at Fang's house, the old lady was secretly disappointed to see that Jou-chia was not as beautiful as the photo. She thought her clothes were not red enough to look like a bride, and especially disapproved of the unlucky white leather shoes on her feet. The second grandma and the third grandma are all dressed up to the fullest. It's hot and sweaty, like a half-melted cream wedding cake. When they saw the appearance of the eldest sister-in-law, they were relieved, but they were not disappointed with her figure. Jou-chia doesn't have Sarah Bernhardt's slender waist when she was young, so swallowing a quinine pill is not like being pregnant, but her thinness is undeniable. The prophecy of \"double happiness entering the door\" has not been fulfilled. Tun-Weng was so happy that he asked questions and said with a smile, \"Hung-chien and his mother can't control him anymore, so I'll leave it all to you.\" Mrs.Fang put in, \"Yes! Hung-chien couldn't do it when he was a child, and he couldn't wear clothes when he was seven. Up to now, I don't know whether he is warm or cold in his clothes, and he eats something sweet and salty, just like a child. Mistress, you should pay attention to him. Hung-chien, you didn't listen to me and married a daughter-in-law. You should always listen to what she said. \" Jou-chia said, \"He doesn't listen to me either-did you hear that, Hung-chien? If you don't listen to me in the future, I will tell my mother-in-law. \" Hung-chien smirked. The second and third grandmothers secretly gave a contemptuous look. When Tun Weng heard Jou-chia wanted to do something, he said, \"I have something to advise you. It's good to do things, but when the couple are working outside together,' the house has no owner, and the broom stands upside down', and the family is in name only. I am not a stubborn person.

It's a pity that I am a refugee here. The house is so crowded that you can't live, otherwise you can learn from your mother-in-law. \" Jou-chia nodded reluctantly. When saluting, a red carpet was laid in front of the sacrificial table, apparently asking Hung-chien and his wife to kneel to the souls of ancestors passing by in the air. Jou-chia stepped straight on the blanket, showing no tendency to bow down. Hung-chien bowed three times side by side with her and finished. The onlookers could not express their horror and opposition. Ah Ch 'ou was quick-witted and asked his father and mother, \"Why don't you kneel down and worship?\" This sentence is like the telephone ringing in an empty house, and there is no interface. Hung-chien was embarrassed, but luckily, Ah Ch 'ou and Ah Hsiung grabbed the red carpet and bowed down. The dangerous fight diverted everyone's attention. Mrs.Fang thought that after they had finished worshipping their ancestors, they would formally kneel down to themselves and Tun Weng. Hung-chien didn't know anything about these ceremonies. He thought he had met each other as soon as he entered the door, so there was no need to bother. Therefore, the meal was not harmonious, and Ah Ch 'ou insisted on sitting next to Jou-chia, asking Auntie to hold such dishes and such dishes, but it was impossible to call them. In the middle of the dish, Jou-chia was impatient with this annoying nephew, so Ah Ch 'ou knelt on the chair, stretched out his arm and went to pick up the dish himself. Accidentally, he knocked Jou-chia's glass over. Jou-chia screamed, and quickly got up and hid. The new clothes had been stained with a wine stain. Mr.and Mrs.Tunweng scolded Ah Chou, but Jou-chia quickly said it didn't matter. Peng Tu and his second wife also scolded their son and forbade him to eat any more. Ah Ch 'ou was so sad that he refused to get off the chair. They hoped that Mr.and Mrs.Hung-chien would put in a good word and save face for their son. Who knew that Hung-chien only asked Jou-chia with concern, \"Can the wine stains be washed away? Luckily, the meatballs he caught didn't roll on your clothes, which was very close! \" Second Daughter-in-law pulled Ah Ch 'ou upstairs with a straight face, but it was too late for everyone to persuade him. When I heard Ah Ch 'ou halfway up the stairs, I screamed with pain, and it was as long as the whistle of a special express train passing through a small station without stopping, and then I cried with it. Peng Tu was heartbroken and gnashed his teeth. \"This child should be beaten. I'll beat him when I go up later.\"\r\nWhen Jou-chia left in the afternoon, Second Daughter-in-law said with a big smile, \"Don't go, stay here today-Third Sister, let's detain her-eldest brother, you are the only one who will take her home! Don't you keep her? \" Ah Ch 'ou's eyes were swollen with tears, and people ignored him. Mrs.Fang, because her son and daughter-in-law didn't kowtow to herself and didn't give them jewelry, sent them out of the door and went back to her room to mutter to Tun Weng. Tun-Weng said, \"No wonder Sun Roujia is not polite. Everyone who comes out of school is barbaric and doesn't know the rules. I don't know her family. It seems that there is no tutor. \"",

Shouldn't I accept both of them?\" Even if Sun Roujia is impolite, the boss should teach her. The more I think about it, the more angry I get. \" Tun-Weng advised, \"Don't be angry. When the boss comes back, I'll teach him a lesson. Hung-chien is really an idiot. I think he will be afraid of his wife in the future. However, Sun Roujia is still like a sensible woman. I just taught her not to go out to do things. You see that she nodded and obeyed. \"\r\nJou-chia went out and said, \"Take care of a dress, even if it is ruined, I don't know if it will wash off or not. I have never seen such an unruly child. \" Hung-chien said, \"I really hate them, too. Fortunately, we won't live together in the future. I know this meal has turned your appetite off today. Speaking of children, I remember, it seems that you should give them money for meeting, and there are also two rewards for employing people. \" Jou-chiaton stamped, \"Why didn't you tell me earlier? I don't have this set at home. I just left school myself and I don't know anything about these grandmothers. It's so troublesome! I am not happy to be your daughter-in-law! \" Hung-chien comforted him, \"Never mind. I'll buy some red envelopes and get them for you.\" Jou-chia said, \"Do whatever you want. I won't please your family anyway. Your two brothers and daughters-in-law are not easy to deal with. What your father said is also bizarre; I, a college graduate from Sun Roujia, came to your house to be an unpaid old lady! Hum! Your home is not that wide. \" Hung-chien couldn't help but reply to Tun-weng, \"He didn't call you an old maid either. He just advised you not to go out to work.\" Jou-chia said, \"Who doesn't want to be happy at home? I don't like going out to work! Let me ask you, how much do you earn to support me at home a month? Or does your family have ancestral possessions? You haven't seen your career in the second half of the year! I earn my money, isn't it good? It' s ironic! \" Hung-chien said angrily, \"This is another matter. His words also have some truth. \" Jou-chia sneered, \"You and your father's brains are antiques thousands of years ago, but you are still an international student.\" Hung-chien also sneered, \"What do you know about antiques? I tell you, my father's opinions are very fashionable in foreign countries. What you lose is that you have never stayed in school. When I was in Germany, I knew about the three K movements of German women: church, kitchen, nursery-\"[1] Jou-chia said,\" I don't want to hear it, just say it. But I didn't know today that you are a dutiful son and listen to your father's words like this-\"This quarrel has not become serious, because you can't go to the bamboo slips to quarrel, you can't go back to the Fang family to quarrel, and it is not appropriate to quarrel on the road, so there is no place for a sword and a lip gun. Homelessness is sometimes a blessing.",

Homelessness is sometimes a blessing.\r\nThe two in-laws met, invited visitors to each other, visited each other, and exchanged contempt in their hearts, and neither was satisfied with the other. The Fang family hates the Sun family for being simple and slow, and the Sun family hates the Fang family's triteness. Both sides think that the other is not rich behind their backs. One day, Tun Weng was inspired by his wife's criticism of his mother. A wonderful entry was added to the diary, saying that he now understood why the two cousins were called \"Qin Jin\": \"During the Spring and Autumn Period, the two countries of Qin Jin were married, but the world sought war. In-laws hate each other, and now they are fierce. It is also appropriate to call them Qin Jin. \" I'm so proud when I've finished writing, I just wish I couldn't give it to Mr.Weng for appreciation. Hung-chien and Jou-chia were in a dilemma. They were so angry that they had to take it out on each other. Hung-chien was angry for his wife, but at the same time he found it convenient to have a wife. Once upon a time, I was angry, so I had to keep it in my heart. I can't vent it at will. No one is my punching bag. It's different now; You can't be as happy with anyone as you are with your wife. Needless to say, parents and brothers have to break up friends, and employers have to go on strike. Only the wife, like the leather bag of Fengshen in Homer's epic, has the largest capacity to suffer indignities. After all, divorce is not easy. Jou-chia also found it unnecessary to be as scrupulous about her husband as she was about her parents. But she is more cultured than Hung-chien. Whenever Hung-chien gets angry, she stops talking. She seemed to grab a rope with Hung-chien, trying to pull at each end. When the rope was about to break, she made a few steps together, and the rope came loose again. Although quarreling is the quickest way to get angry, after quarreling, they all feel tired and empty, like the psychology after the play is over and the wine wakes up. The quarrel before returning to Shanghai is as good as it is, just like the food of a rich family, without staying overnight. The feud that gradually quarrels will only disappear every other day, or even go away, and talk without making peace. After a quarrel, Jou-chia said, half seriously and half jokingly, \"When you lose your temper, you are like a beast biting people. You are not only unreasonable, but also heartless. Although you are the eldest son, I don't think your father and mother dote on you very much. Why are you so headstrong? \" Hung-chien smiled with shame. He just won by cursing each other, and the victory made him lenient. There is no need to respectfully say, \"My husband's mother prefers boys to girls, and she doesn't cherish you, but you are hard enough to serve.\"\r\nAfter he went to Sun's home twice, he could see that Jou-chia used to keep saying \"Mom and Dad\", while Mrs.Sun's indifference to her daughter was tantamount to laissez-faire. Mr.Sun is a so-called good man in a bad sense-a useless man. He works as an accounting director in a newspaper office and has no influence. Mrs.Sun is an old son, and the Sun family has been handed down for three generations, and the upbringing of her son is regarded as a religion. They have done their duty to provide for their daughter's graduation from college, and have no mind to take care of her affairs.",

They have done their duty to provide for their daughter's graduation from college, and have no mind to take care of her affairs. If the son-in-law is very rich, maybe their interest in Jou-chia will increase. Jou-chia is close to her aunt, an American student, a female student who calls her child \"your Baby\" and her wife \"your Mrs\". This aunt, Jou-chia, of course called her Auntie. She made a splash when she was young, and now she can't forget that she is very severe in criticizing the rising female students. Jou-chia likes listening to her memories best, so she is loved alone. Mr.and Mrs.Sun are very afraid of this aunt, and most of the family affairs should be asked by her. Her husband, Mr.Lu, has an unforgivable smug face and likes to talk about current events. Because he is slightly deaf, people have no strength to argue with him, and he only hears his own voice in his heart, which is even more unreasonable. The husband and wife hold important positions in a big cotton mill. Mr.Wang is the chief engineer and his wife is the head of the personnel department. So Jou-chia also found a position in the personnel department. Mrs.Gu thinks that my niece is the wrong person, and she frankly despises Hung-chien's abilities and qualifications. Every time Hung-chien met her, he felt inferior, just like the price rose again in wartime. Mrs.Gu has no children and keeps a little pug named Bobby as her life. The dog bit Hung-chien when he saw him. His mistress often said, \"Dogs are the most clever and can tell the good from the bad,\" which made him even more angry. Helpless, a dog regards its master as precious, just as a husband values his wife, or a wife values her husband, he dare not hit it. Jou-chia wants her aunt to like her husband and often teaches Hung-chien to take the dog out for Mrs.Lu to pee and shit, which can't improve Hung-chien's feelings for dogs.\r\nHung-chien once said maliciously to Jou-chia, \"Your aunt loves dogs more than you.\" Jou-chia said, \"Stop fooling around!\" -adding a meaningless sentence-\"That's her temper.\" Hung-chien said, \"She likes keeping company with dogs so much, which means she doesn't deserve to be with people.\" Jou-chia glared. \"I think dogs are sometimes better than people. At least Bobby is better than you. He is very affectionate and doesn't bite people indiscriminately. You should bite when you meet someone like you. \" Hung-chien said, \"You must be like your aunt and get a dog in the future. Alas, as an unlucky person like me, I should get a dog. Relatives look down on me, friends don't, and my wife-er-tends to get angry and ignore people. A dog wags its tail at me. Finally, there is something lower than me in the world that wants to please me. Your aunt has male and female workers fawning on her in the factory, but at home, it goes without saying that her niece is obedient to her! She should be satisfied, and she needs a running dog to shake her head and tail! It can be seen that a person's capacity for flattery has no bottom. \" Jou-chia controlled her voice and said, \"Would you please say less? You can't have three days of silence. Just a few days later, you have nothing to do. \" Hung-chien laughed nonsense and said, \"How fierce! How fierce! \"\r\nHung-chien's feelings for Pugs are half true. Just as he regretted going to the mainland last year, he now regrets listening to Jou-chia and going back to Shanghai.",

Just as he regretted going to the mainland last year, he now regrets listening to Jou-chia and going back to Shanghai. When he was in a small town, he was afraid of people's rivalry. When he arrived in a big city, he hated people's indifference, but he felt that he still respected his expression. Even a tiny bug is smug, hoping that someone will put it under the microscope and look at it. Loneliness in the crowd and desolation in the excitement make him like many people living on this island, and his mind is like an island without a bank. Shanghai this year is very different from last year. The situation in Europe took a turn for the worse, so the Japanese became more and more presumptuous in the two major concessions. Britain and the United States, which later fought side by side with China, only wanted to remain neutral at that time; Since it failed to win, it could not stand at all. As a result, this \"neutrality\" became just a foothold in China, and all of it was ceded to the Japanese 2. \"John Bull\" is always bragging; Uncle Sham turned out to be just an iceberg, not Mount Tai; As for the \"Gallic cock\", it does have the instinct of a rooster-it is a pity that the sun flag is mistaken for the real sun. Shiploads of scrap iron from the United States have been shipped to Japan, and Britain is considering blocking the Yunnan-Myanmar highway. Although France has not cut off the border between Yunnan and Vietnam, it has detained a batch of arms from China. Prices are like a kite with a broken line, and they are like a fairy, and the ground is soaring. Public utility workers have repeatedly gone on strike, and trams and cars only wish they could not be listed as full as theaters and hotels. All the copper coins and nickels have been searched, and the stamps have a new use, and they are temporarily used as tokens. Unfortunately, people can't send them as letters, otherwise the difficulty of crowded cars can be avoided. The competition for survival gradually took off the ornaments and masks, revealing the original viciousness. Shame is not cheap, many people can't afford to maintain it. At the same time, the number of people who are struggling to make a fortune and giving birth to a broken country is increasing, and they are not guilty of each other: because the poor only beg in the busy streets, they will not go to the quiet residential areas of the rich; People who only ask for money on foot can't keep up with the streamlined car that the rich man takes. Slums gradually spread, like a tinea on the city appearance, and political terrorist incidents occur almost every day. People with lofty ideals are slowly oppressed like the traffic routes of western metropolises and develop underground, and the original vicious and ambiguous humanoid reptiles under the ground cling to them to raise their prices. Newspapers advocating \"peace between China and Japan\" publish a list of new comrades every day, and these \"collaborators\" often declare \"no politics\" in another newspaper at the same time.\r\nOn the fifth day of his return home, Hung-chien went to Huamei News Agency to meet the editor-in-chief, and Hsin-mei made an appointment for him by correspondence in Hong Kong. He didn't want to ask his father-in-law for guidance, so he went to the building where the newspaper office was located alone. The newspaper office is on the third floor, and the sign hanging outside the elevator indicates that it will not stop until the fourth floor. Although he knew the poem \"but you widen your view three hundred miles, by going up one flight of stairs\" in the Tang Dynasty, he didn't take the elevator. After walking two floors, he was already discouraged. He hoped that adding a few more stairs would delay some time.",

Push the spring door, and a long row of counters separates the people inside the museum from the people outside; If this counter is equipped with copper bars, it will be no different from banks, pawn shops and post offices. The newspaper office is divided into two rooms, inside and outside. At the writing desk across the hall from the outside, a young woman sits with her ring finger with a diamond ring cocked and her nails dyed red. She didn't look up when someone pushed the door in. In normal times, Hung-chien might wonder why people in the office have stained their fingers with ink and their nails with red oil, but in a hurry, they inadvertently took off their hats and asked questions through the cupboard. She looked up, her face solemn and inviolable, as if she had suffered from a man in her previous life and was still wary in this life. She looked at him, pointed out that red mouth was leaning to the left, and bowed her head to get a manicure. Following her instructions, Hung-chien saw a small square hole like a train station where tickets were bought, and it was written \"convey\". He hurried to have a look, and there was a boy of sixteen or seventeen who was sorting out letters. He called his attention and said, \"Sorry, I'm looking for the editor-in-chief, Mr.Wang.\" The child only managed his letters and replied casually, \"He didn't come.\" He said these four words with the most economical oral muscle movement, which was just enough for Hung-chien to hear and stop. He didn't move a nerve, but used a little more sound. Hung-chien was so flustered that his legs went weak and said, \"Hey, why didn't he come! You won't? Please go in and have a look. \" After two years of communication, the child is sophisticated and understands that visitors can be divided into two categories: small guests who humbly ask \"I'm sorry, how can you do it?\" and big guests who gruffly command \"Kid, this is my film, look for someone.\" Today, this one belongs to the former category. I am busy at this time and have no time to talk to him. Hung-chien thought to himself, if this thing is done, he must find a way to expel the kid, and then he said bravely, \"Mr.Wang asked me to come at this time.\" Hearing this, the child asked the woman, \"Miss Jiang, is Mr.Wang here?\" She shook her head impatiently and said, \"Who knows him!\" The child sighed and stood up lazily, asking Hung-chien for a film. Hung-chien didn't have a film, but only gave his surname Fang. The child was about to fulfill the responsibility of communication when a man came and the child asked by the way, \"Is Mr.Wang here?\" The man said, \"It seems that he didn't come. I haven't seen him today. I'm afraid he will come this afternoon.\" The child spread his hands, indicating that he could not become Mr.Wang. Hung-chien suddenly saw his father-in-law working at a desk far away from the window, like meeting an old friend in a foreign land. Immediately accompanied by the father-in-law, I met Mr.Wang and had a very speculative talk. Mr.Wang insisted on seeing him out of the counter because he was coming for the first time. The woman stopped manicuring her nails and was busy using a Chinese typewriter. She still had her ring finger with a diamond ring stuck up. Mr.Wang taught Hung-chien to go up to the fourth floor and take the elevator down. When he came to work tomorrow, he also took the elevator to the fourth floor and then down, which saved a flight of stairs. Hung-chien was very happy when he learned his lesson, and felt that he was already an old newspaper worker.",

Hung-chien was very happy when he learned his lesson, and felt that he was already an old newspaper worker. That night, I wrote to Hsin-mei, thanking him for his introduction, and joked that according to my experience in the communication office today, I am afraid that other reports and news in this newspaper will not be accurate.\r\nHouses are harder to find than jobs. There are houses all over the street, but it's not their turn to live. Shanghai seems to hope that every newcomer will be like a snail with a shell and take a dormitory with him. The two of them were exhausted in looking for a house, and they lost their breath. Finally, relying on Tun Weng's face, he rented two small rooms in his relatives' home without tipping. Some of the relatives' families are going back to their hometown, because the Fang family's big house is empty and not occupied, and they are willing to stay. Tun Weng proposed to exchange these two rooms. As soon as it is said, Tun Weng has reason to show his merits to his son and daughter-in-law. Of course, the son obeyed, and when the daughter-in-law returned to her mother's house, Mrs.Sun said, \"Joke! He should have given you a house a long time ago. Why does Hung-chien's sister-in-law have a good house to live in? If you marry Fang Jia, Fang Jia should give you a house. Just don't have a house, harm you newlyweds break up, they don't live for you, now find two rooms, what's the big deal! I often say that marriage should not be too presumptuous. For example, if this person has a house at home, he should ask. \" Fortunately, Jou-chia didn't tell her husband these words, otherwise there would be a quarrel. She found that although Hung-chien disliked his home very much, he would never let others criticize it. In order to buy furniture, the two also argued. Hung-chien thought that as long as he borrowed some from his old home, he would have to pass. Jou-chia is a real woman. She values the territory under her jurisdiction more than he does, and needs to earn some furniture. Hung-chien accompanied her to the wood shop. When she saw a table, she wanted to buy it. Jou-chia only asked the price, and took a closer look at the table inside and outside, keeping it in mind. Go to several other wood shops and compare the goods and prices. Hung-chien was impatient. After one time, he refused to accompany her. She didn't want him to accompany her, so she went to consult her aunt.\r\nThe furniture is rough and ready, and Mr.and Mrs.Lu come to see their niece's new house. Mr.Lu said that the stairs were too dark and the landlord should be taught to install an electric light. Mrs.Lu thought both rooms were too small, saying that Hung-chien's father should have asked for at least one big room in the two rooms. After listening to his wife, Mr.Lu was not deaf and said, \"That's right. Hung-chien, I don't think that house in your house is very big. Otherwise, they rent your big house and you rent their small room, which is too bad, hehe. \" When he smiled, Bobby followed suit. He also asked Hung-chien what news had been in the newspaper these two days. Hung-chien said, \"There is no news.\" He didn't hear clearly and asked, \"What?\" Hung-chien leaned close to his ear and said loudly, \"Nothing-\"He jumped up and frowned and rubbed his ear canal. \"Scared, the breath in your mouth went straight into my ear, and it tickled me to death!\"",
        "07b6ce63-a637-48cc-ad48-9746ec5194c7": "Mrs.Lu thought both rooms were too small, saying that Hung-chien's father should have asked for at least one big room in the two rooms.

I don't read Chinese newspapers, I only read English newspapers. \" Hung-chien said, \"These two days, Poland is finished, Germany and Russia are very powerful, and Britain has suppressed it. Maybe everyone will have no English newspapers to read in the future, so my aunt should learn Russian and German.\" Mrs.Lu got angry and said that she didn't want to learn German. All the guys in the grocery store knew Russian. Mr.Lu understood the point of contention, and he also talked about it, saying that there was the United States, and what he was afraid of, but Britain did not count. Jou-chia blamed Hung-chien for their departure. Hung-chien said, \"This is my house. I don't welcome them.\" Jou-chia said, \"The chair you are sitting in at this time is a gift from them.\" Hung-chien stood up quickly. Looking around, all the chairs and sofas were given by Mrs.Lu, he sat on the bed and said, \"Who taught them to give them? Just return it to them. I would rather sit on the floor. \" Jou-chia laughed angrily. \"This rude remark can only be said by children. It's not interesting when you tell it.\" Men or women who listen to the opposite sex as \"children\" are all tamed; Jou-chia doesn't call Hung-chien that way, but these three words are effective enough.\r\nMr.and Mrs.Tunweng also came to see the furnished room one morning. Jou-chia went to the office, and Hung-chien often went to the newspaper office after dinner. His mother went upstairs first and said, \"Dad is at the door. He brought you something. Please go down and carry it up quickly-don't send maids and servants, you may break the glass.\" Hung-chien hurried down to meet his father and took an old-fashioned bell hanging on the wall to the room. Tun-Weng asked him if he remembered this clock, and Hung-chien shook his head. Tun Weng said generously, \"It's a dream for your generation to protect your ancestors and pass them on from generation to generation! Didn't grandpa buy this clock and hang it in the back hall of his hometown? \" Hung-chien remembered. This is one of the things that the old two and the old three went home to pick up the robbery last spring and hired a night boat to move out. Tun-Weng said, \"When you were young, you liked to listen to the sound of this clock. Grandpa said, I'll give it to you when you grow up-alas, you don't remember it at all! Last week, I paid a watchmaker to have it repaired, but none of the machines were broken. Things used to be strong, but now clocks and watches are so useful! \" Mrs.Fang also said, \"I think Jou-chia's watch is so small that all the machines in it will not be complete.\" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Mother has spoken layman's words again. Sparrows are small and complete'; Of course, the machine has everything, but it is not big. \" His mother said, \"I mean, it's not strong.\" Tun-weng picked out the place to hang the clock, paid the maid to borrow the ladder from the landlord's house, and watched Hung-chien go up and hang it, making a sweat for the clock.",

Sparrows are small and complete'; Of course, the machine has everything, but it is not big. \" His mother said, \"I mean, it's not strong.\" Tun-weng picked out the place to hang the clock, paid the maid to borrow the ladder from the landlord's house, and watched Hung-chien go up and hang it, making a sweat for the clock. When the ladder was removed, he looked at the clock on the wall and said to his son, \"Actually, it can be higher-let it go and don't touch it again.\" This clock is very accurate. I tried it yesterday. It only goes seven minutes slow at every o'clock. Remember, it has to go seven minutes slow. \" Mrs.Fang looked at the furniture and said, \"This kind of wood is not strong. The furniture is made of mahogany. How much did you buy it? \" When she heard that it was from Jou-chia's uncle, she asked, \"Did Jou-chia's family give her anything?\" Hung-chien lied, \"Her parents bought the utensils in that guest room and dining room-\"Seeing her mother's face didn't mean satisfaction-\"And everything under the kitchen was also made by her husband's family.\" Mrs.Fang's expression was still unsatisfied, but Hung-chien couldn't think of anything valuable to earn face for his in-laws. Mrs.Fang pointed to the iron bed and said, \"You obviously bought this yourself, not from her aunt.\" Hung-chien said impatiently, \"You can't teach people to send a bed.\" Mrs.Fang suddenly remembered that decorating the new house is also the responsibility of her husband's family, so she stopped talking. Mr.and Mrs.Tunweng asked Jou-chia when she would come back every day, what kind of food she usually ate, whether the maid cooked well, how much she spent a day, how many loads of coal balls she used in January, and so on. Hung-chien couldn't answer most of the time. Tun-weng shook his head, and the old lady said, \"It's careless of the whole family to entrust a servant. Is this Li Ma reliable? \" Hung-chien said, \"She's Jou-chia's wet nurse. She's very loyal and can't steal.\" Tun-Weng snorted, \"What do you know, you fool?\" The old lady said, \"We can't do without a hostess at home. I will persuade Jou-chia not to do anything. How much money will she earn in a month! In charge of housekeeping, the money has come down from the whole province. \" Hung-chien couldn't help telling the truth: \"She is well rewarded in the factory and earns twice as much money as I do!\" The parents were hostile and silent. The old lady felt that her son was partial to her daughter-in-law, and the old man felt that his son had completely failed her husband. When he got home, Tun Weng said, \"Boss must be afraid of his wife. How can a woman earn more money than he does? Can such a husband still cheer up? \" Mrs.Fang said, \"I don't believe Jou-chia has any skills. Our boss is not as good as her when she stays abroad! She should leave things in the factory to the boss. \" Tun-Weng sighed, \"My son is worthless. Let him go!\"\r\nJou-chia went home and just entered the room. The clock welcomed her, and the clockwork whimpered for a while, ringing five times. She said in surprise, \"Where did this come from? Ah, no! It's almost six o'clock on my watch. \" Li Ma reports one by one. Jou-chia asked, \"Did the old lady look under the stove?\" Li Ma said no. Jou-chia asked her what vegetables she bought today, and said with relief, \"These dishes are very good, but we didn't invite the old lady to see them. Don't think that we have lost her son because of hunger.\"",

You can't change it. How can I eat so much! You should try your best to give it to your uncle. They eat a lot, and their mouths are greedy. If they are not full, they will lose their temper. \" Li Ma said, \"Isn't it? My man Lao Li also-\"Jou-chia didn't expect that she would compare Hung-chien with Lao Li, so she stopped and said,\" I know, I heard you say that you ate zongzi at the Dragon Boat Festival, and he ate all the top of zongzi with red beans and gave it to you, right? \" Li Ma added: \"Zongzi is bigger than a child, and it is not cooked. I ate raw rice and my stomach swelled for several days!\" \" When Hung-chien came back in the evening to explain the history of Zhong, Jou-chia said, \"It's a treasure handed down by the Fang government for three generations-hey, why is it still seven o'clock?\" Hung-chien told her the fact that she walked seven minutes slowly at every hour. Jou-chia said with a smile, \"In that case, I'm afraid it means seven o'clock, or seven o'clock yesterday or even the day before yesterday. What's the use of it?\" She also said that when Hung-chien was angry, he stretched his face, which was very similar to the outline of this clock. Hung-chien caught a cold these two days, and his throat was choked with phlegm. Jou-chia clapped her hands and said, \"I found that you were snoring in your throat before you spoke, and the sound of clockwork turning when you hit it was very similar. You are the demon that this clock turned out to be. \" They talked and laughed, as if there was no such thing as a couple turning against each other in the world.\r\nOne Saturday afternoon, the second and third grandmothers came together for their first visit. When Hung-chien didn't come back from the newspaper office, Jou-chia hurried to make tea and buy snacks for entertainment, and said, \"Why didn't you bring the two children? Bring some candy back to them. \" Third Daughter-in-law said, \"Ah Xiong was clamoring to come with me. I didn't take him because I was afraid he would get into trouble.\" Second Daughter-in-law said, \"I told Ah Xiong that Auntie's house is clean, and it's no better than peeing anywhere at home. My uncle has to take a taxi.\" Jou-chia said dishonestly, \"What nonsense! Good. Bring him. \" Third Daughter-in-law felt that her son had lost face and retaliated by saying, \"Our Ah Hsiung has no spirituality. Ah Ch 'ou is not much older than him, so he is very thoughtful. Don't think he is a child! For example, he soiled your clothes that time and ate a beating. From then on, he kept it in mind and dared not fool around with you. \" For the sake of their son, the two split temporarily, and then they got together in an instant, admiring the comfort of Jou-chia's small family and saying that she was so lucky. Third Daughter-in-law said bitterly, \"I don't know when and when we will be able to separate from each other! Of course, living together now, I have also touched a lot of light from my second sister. \"",

Of course, living together now, I have also touched a lot of light from my second sister. \" Second Daughter-in-law said, \"There is only one house in their house to exchange with others, so we can't take it.\" Jou-chia said quickly, \"I'd like to live in a big family, too, to save things and expenses.\" Open your own portal has the trouble of opening your own portal, such as daily necessities, water and electricity, all of which must be managed by yourself. Hung-chien is not as capable as his second and third brothers. \" Second daughter-in-law said, \"That's right! I'm not like Third Sister. I know I'm a good-for-nothing. If I can't open my own door, I'd better live in a big family. Like you, you are thick and meticulous, and you have reliable employees. Eldest brother will make money again. We have to compare with you, and the difference is too far. \" Jou-chia was afraid that they would go back and talk, and dared not be too tit for tat. They looked at the appliances in the two rooms carefully and asked the price. They all praised Jou-chia for being smart and able to buy things, but they kept saying, \"I saw such a table (or chair) somewhere, and the price seemed cheaper, but unfortunately I didn't buy it.\" Third Daughter-in-law asked Jou-chia, \"Do you have a room for boxes?\" Jou-chia said, \"No. I don't have many boxes, they are all in the bedroom. \" Second Daughter-in-law said, \"The alley houses in Shanghai are too small. Even if there is a room for boxes, there are not many boxes. When I married Fangjia, there was a back room behind the new house. I couldn't put down the boxes, pots, buckets and desktops that I married, which made the new house full. It was really unpleasant to see. \" Third Daughter-in-law said, \"Am I just like you? It's sad to think that the dead Japanese robbed us of all these things! Now, if you want nothing, you have to buy it again. I have seven or eight sets of leather clothes, from pearl cheongsam to gray-backed coat, but now I don't have to wear them myself! \" Second Daughter-in-law also made a false account of her wedding dress, and said, \"It's just as good as big sister. Foreign countries are at war, and Shanghai doesn't know what to do yet! Maybe it's hard for us to escape again. There are too many things, so I can't take them with me, and I can't bear to lose them. Third sister, you still have something. I don't have anything. It's just as well to walk naked, haha! We should go back. \" Jou-chia realized that they had come to investigate their marriage, and she was so angry that she lost her appetite for dinner.\r\nWhen Hung-chien came home, he found her indifferent and joked with her, \"I met my aunt's nail in the office today, didn't I?\" She turned her face and said, \"I'm angry, are you kidding?\" Everyone in my family is good to me, and only your family members come to my door to be angry. \" Hung-chien panicked and wondered if his mother had come to teach her a lesson. He kept everything his mother said from her last time and quickly said, \"Who is it?\" Jou-chia said, \"Who else? Your two precious brothers and daughters-in-law. \" Hung-chien repeatedly said, \"Yuck!\" Relax. Jou-chia said, \"This is your house. Of course, your family can go straight ahead. I have no sovereignty at all.",

That sentence is my fault. You tell me how they bully you. I think you are also very interested. Can you beat them both by yourself? \" Jou-chia said, \"I'm interested? Not as interested as your family! All of them have three heads and six arms, and they have more hearts than others, and they have a few more tricks in their hearts and their intestines are knotted. I fell asleep and dreamed that they killed me, cooked me, and ate me. My dream is still awake. \" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"Why not! But you slept like a dead man. I came back from the newspaper office a little late, so you couldn't wake up. \" Jou-chia said with a straight face, \"If you talk nonsense, I will ignore you.\" Hung-chien apologized, asked why, and said angrily, \"If I had been at home then, I would have been rude to expose them. They have something to accompany them and brag to you! \" Jou-chia said, \"This can't be wronged. After they got married, you have gone abroad, and you haven't seen their ostentation and extravagance.\" Hung-chien said, \"Although I wasn't there at that time, I was familiar with their family background. The second child's husband's family is particularly poor. When I was in college, I wanted to send my daughter to the door, but my father opposed early marriage. This matter was discussed for a while and then put aside for several years. \" Jou-chia sighed, \"It's my bad luck! Now I am forced to be commensurate with people and sisters like them, and I have to be humiliated by them. When they looked at the furniture, it was faintly said that we bought it expensive; They are a pair of capable grandmothers, and they are concerned about me. Why don't you come and buy it for me earlier? \" Hung-chien asked urgently, \"Did you also say that you bought the equipment in that room?\" Jou-chia said, \"I told you, why?\" Hung-chien patted himself on the back of the head and said, \"Shit! Terrible! I regret that I didn't tell you that day, \"so I told Mrs.Fang what she asked her husband to send.\" Jou-chia jumped up and said, \"Why didn't you say so earlier? How dare I go to your house to be a man! When they go back, they will definitely talk about right and wrong, even thinking that the furniture given by my aunt was bought by us. You're too stupid to tell a lie. Of course, you should have said hello to me. Ever since you got married, you've always liked to be smart, and all the results are self-defeating. \" Hung-chien knew he was wrong, but refused to accept the scolding. He argued, \"I told this lie out of kindness. I didn't tell you later because I was afraid that you would be angry. \" Jou-chia said, \"Yes, I am very angry when I know. Thank you for your kindness and lying to save face for my family. You should tell your mother honestly that I bought this in advance of my salary in the factory. Our grandson is poor, and we have nothing to give her when we marry our daughter. Did your family spend any money on your son's wife? Did you give your son and daughter-in-law anything?",
        "7b176225-741e-4808-afb5-a85ddeae7480": "You're too stupid to tell a lie. Of course, you should have said hello to me.

Scared, we still rent these two houses-oh, I forgot, and this clock-\"She looked at Hung-chien's long face and gave him a mirror-\"Look for yourself, don't they look like clocks? I didn't say anything wrong. \" Hung-chien couldn't help laughing.\r\nThese many unpleasant little things make Jou-chia afraid to go to her husband's house. She often lamented, \"We haven't lived with them yet, and we've caused a lot of trouble. It takes training to live a big family life. Just look at how much your two sisters-in-law have trained. They are quick-witted and quick-mouthed. I'm Mato, but they don't have the heart to fight with them. Let them be filial daughters-in-law. I just wonder, you grew up in a big family, how come you don't know this kind of trick in your family? \" Hung-chien said, \"Unmarried men won't know about these things. They won't open their eyes until they get married. I sometimes think that my family is really a nest of right and wrong like San Lv University. If I had been married for a few years and then went to San Lv University, I might have been well-trained and sensitive, so I wouldn't have been blindsided. \" Jou-chia said quickly, \"Why do you say this? If you had married long ago, I wouldn't have married you-unless you regretted marrying me. \" Hung-chien was in a bad mood and was not in the mood to cater to Jou-chia. He just said to himself, \"School for scandal[2], it's all school for Scandal, family, school, and the same to you.\" Although they both regard their home as a \"rumor school\", it is not easy to play truant. Tun Weng brought a clock that day and gave his son a list of ancestors' birthdays, indicating that his son and daughter-in-law should go back to attend the ceremony these days. Jou-chia pouted when she saw it. Luckily, she had an office as an excuse and couldn't come back for lunch. However, some days when the anniversary of her death was just Sunday, if she wanted to forget it on purpose, Tun-weng would pay the second or third daughter-in-law to call the landlord's house to invite her. What's particularly annoying is that every relative of Fang's family occasionally mentions that they haven't seen grandma, and the Tunweng couple immediately call Jou-chia, whether she just came home from the office at six o'clock in the afternoon, or she will go out to play on Saturday, or she will go to her aunt's house or her parents' house on Sunday. Jou-chia was exhausted by her dead ancestors and living relatives, and she often complained to Hung-chien, \"Your family is really a noble family, with so many ancestors! Why not even count the emperor's birthday and death? \" \"You just really everyone! What's the use of having so many relatives? \" After several perfunctory attempts, she turned her back and asked Li Ma to answer the phone, saying that she was not at home. I refused to go four or five times, and gradually I was afraid to go, afraid to look at their faces. Hung-chien sympathized with his wife, but didn't dare to offend his parents, so he had to go home alone. However, the family members seemed to blame him for not being \"female\" and took Jou-chia. He can't hand over people, and he also shirks his responsibilities and refuses to go home often.\r\nIf there is nothing wrong with the definition of \"loyalty is the center\", Li Ma is unfaithful because she is eccentric.",

When Hung-chien asks her to do something, she often asks Jou-chia for approval first. For example, when Hung-chien asked her to buy green vegetables, she said, \"Miss likes spinach, I have to ask her first.\" Jou-chia, of course, pays her to do what Hung-chien wants. Hung-chien said to her, \"It's cold, so I won't wear my clothes anymore. Today, the sun is fine. Take it out for me to bask in, and put it away for the young lady later. \" She insisted that Jou-chia's clothes had not been put away yet, so he didn't have to worry. The weather would get warmer, so we could dry them together when Jou-chia was drying clothes. Jou-chia has gone out, and he can't make Li Ma understand that young women wear different clothes from men. As long as their coats are thicker, they can wear clothes in winter. Li Ma retorted, \"Grandfather, drying clothes is a girl's business, so you don't have to worry about it. Miss went out on business early in the morning. Why don't you go out? Why don't you go out at this time and come back early at night? \" Such things make him angry and funny. When she laughed, she called her \"Mrs.Li\" or \"Her Majestic\" [3], and when she was angry, she wished she could not be asked to leave. When the couple quarreled, when she heard it, her face was as tight as that of the two hosts, and she didn't look at Hung-chien, so it was just a shoving. He muttered to Jou-chia afterwards, \"This is outrageous! If you join together as a master and a servant, you will abuse me to death. \" Jou-chia said with a smile, \"I have tried to persuade her several times. She wants to help me. What can I do? She said that all women eat the loss of their husbands, and she eats the loss of Lao Li herself-eating raw rice dumplings. However, I can't sing alone in your home, and now I will teach you a taste. \"\r\nJou-chia's father and son-in-law are polite and distant. Her brother finds that her brother-in-law Wu can't play football or tennis, Wen can't repair the radio or drive a car, and thinks that her sister married the wrong person. Hung-chien did his half-time job and occasionally went to the Sun family. Fortunately, Jou-chia doesn't often go back to her mother's house, but only visits her aunt's house for three or two days. After moving into their new house for more than a month, Hung-chien and his wife went to Lujia for dinner. When they finished eating and left, Mrs.Lu smiled stiffly: \"Hung-chien, I want to annoy you and advise you not to bully Jou-chia in the future.\" As if her native language was not strong enough, she signed a diplomatic treaty. \"I won't allow it if you bully her again.\" Hung-chien first heard that she had \"disgusting words\" to persuade him. As early as a porcupine met an enemy, his hair stood upright. When she finished, she didn't understand what she meant. She was about to ask questions. Jou-chia quickly said, \"Auntie, he's very kind to me. Whoever said he bullied me, I'm not easy to bully.\" Mrs.Lu said, \"Hung-chien, listen to Jou-chia. She's still protecting you!\" Hung-chien said angrily, \"How did you know that I bullied her? I-\"Jou-chia pulled him,\" Let's go!",

Auntie is joking with you. \" Hung-chien went out and said, \"I'm not in the mood for a movie. Go alone.\" Jou-chia said, \"Hey! I didn't offend you. You always believe that I won't tell her anything. \" Hung-chien blew up: \"That's why I don't want to go to Lujia with you. It's not enough to suffer losses in your own home, but you have to go to the door to be taught a lesson! I bully you! Hum, if I don't bully you to death, you'll live a long life! On the contrary, people in our family are difficult to talk to! You Sun family are all like that fucking pug from top to bottom. My reputation is terrible anyway. I'll just bully you today. I'll go my way. You can go to the movies or go back to your parents' house! \" Push Jou-chia's hooked hands off. Jou-chia didn't care if she didn't go to the movies, but her husband's words were rude, even ignoring the biological possibility, and she was angry with dogs as crustaceans compared with her own family. It's not good to make noise in the street, so he said, \"What's wrong with me going to the movies alone? I don't want you to accompany me. \" With a twist of his head, he left his husband and crossed the street to the tram stop alone. Hung-chien stood alone, feeling lost, looking forward to Jou-chia's back haunting the crowd across the street, which was extremely delicate. I don't know where the pity and protection came from, so I rushed over. Jou-chia was walking when someone patted her on the shoulder and jumped with fear. Looking back, she looked at Hung-chien and was pleasantly surprised. She said, \"Why are you here?\" Hung-chien said, \"I was afraid you'd run away with someone, so I came to spy on you.\" Jou-chia said with a smile, \"If you are noisy like this, I will run away one day, but I will never run away with anyone. Aren't you angry enough? I am so stupid to find a man. \" Hung-chien said, \"What I don't admit today is that your aunt wronged me.\" Jou-chia said, \"Well, my family has wronged you, and I apologize to you. Today's movie is my treat. \" Hung-chien put his hands into the pockets of his coat, vest and trousers to get money. Jou-chia smiled at him and said, \"The tram is coming. Don't catch lice in the street. Why not put the money together when you have a wallet? There's not much money. When I tidy your clothes, I have a banknote in my east pocket and a stamp in my west pocket. \" Hung-chien said, \"Before I got married, I invited my friends to dinner. I put the money in my wallet and took it out to put on a show when I paid the bill. Now that the wallet is old, I threw it somewhere. \" Jou-chia said, \"It's irritating to talk about it. I haven't had a good meal with you before I got married. Now that I'm your wife, don't think you can invite me to eat in a decent way. \" Hung-chien said, \"I can't afford dinner today. I gave my father this month's money the day before yesterday. Petty money is enough to treat you to a snack. After watching the movie, let's find a place to have tea. \"",

After eating snacks, you can't eat dinner, and all the things left are ruined. Don't eat snacks-haha, you see how virtuous I am and a writer; Only your old lady still says I don't care about housework. \" Halfway through the movie, Hung-chien suddenly interrupted her attention and whispered, \"I see, it must be that old man Li Ma moved his mouth. Didn't you send her something to Lujia the day before yesterday?\" She had expected such a thing, so she kept it to herself and said, \"I'll go back and ask her. You mustn't argue with her, I'll teach her a lesson. She was kicked out and couldn't find a replacement: people like us, with small units, don't play cards, don't treat guests, and can't afford big wages, can't use them firmly. As for my aunt, I will naturally explain. When you watch a movie at this time, don't think about those things, and I won't talk. I have missed a paragraph. \"\r\nWhen her husband turned his back, Jou-chia questioned Li Ma. Li Ma denied it: \"I didn't say anything, only that my uncle was very short-tempered.\" Jou-chia said, \"That's enough,\" and warned her not to do it again. During those two days, Li Ma did everything to Hung-chien. Jou-chia wanted to talk to her aunt about everything in Fang's family. Fortunately, she didn't let it out, otherwise Hung-chien would make a big noise, and he was most proud. As for the trifles in her own family, she knew that Hung-chien would never tell the Fang family, which she believed. I married Hung-chien myself, but I'm still a Sun family psychologically. Hung-chien married himself and gradually became isolated from the Fang family. It can be seen that it is better to be a girl, only her father is confused and protects her brother.\r\nHung-chien refused to accompany her to Lujia from now on, and Jou-chia dared not force it. Every time she came back from her trip, she talked about who she met and what news she heard this time. Hung-chien always felt sour in his heart and felt left out, so he made a few sarcastic remarks. One Sunday morning, after breakfast, Jou-chia said, \"I'm going out, Hung-chien. Are you allowed?\" Hung-chien said, \"Are you going to your aunt's house? Hum, I forbid you, you are still going! Why do you ask me? Isn't it good to go in the second half of the day? \" Jou-chia said, \"I'm free to come and go. I'll give you face and ask you, but I'll make you jealous of sugar. The days in winter are short, so it's no fun to go in the afternoon. At this time, the sun is fine, and I will bring wool to knot your wool vest and discuss with her. \" Hung-chien sneered, \"Of course I won't come back for dinner. It's easy for two people to be at home at noon on Sunday, and you have to go out to eat without me. \" Jou-chia said, \"Yo! What a pity! It's like you can't leave me for a moment! I'm at home. Do you have something to say to me? Walking up and down alone, sighing, asking what's on your mind, ignoring it-it's Sunday, let's not make any noise, okay?",

I'll be back when I go. \"Before he could answer, I went back to my bedroom to change clothes. She changed her clothes and came out. Hung-chien sat in the chair, his face covered with the newspaper, and he did not move. She touched his hair and said, \"Why don't you get up in the morning and don't comb your hair?\" You can get a haircut today. I'm leaving. \" Hung-chien ignored him. Jou-chia glanced at him and turned away without reading the newspaper.\r\nAs soon as she entered the door in the afternoon, she asked Li Ma, \"Is your uncle out?\" Li Ma said, \"My uncle just got a haircut and sent it back, but he hasn't gone to the newspaper office yet.\" She went upstairs and said, \"Hung-chien, I'm back. Today, my father, my brother and my uncle's two nieces are here. They want to take me shopping. I'm afraid you'll be anxious, so I'll come back early. \"\r\nHung-chien looked at the clock on the wall with profound meaning, then quickly reached out his hand to look at the watch and said, \"It's getting late, it's almost four o'clock. Let me see, I went out at nine o'clock in the morning, didn't I? I'll wait for you to eat until-\"\r\nJou-chia said with a smile, \"You are shameless and a scoundrel! You know very well that I won't come back for dinner, and when I go out, I will pay Li Ma to have dinner for you at twelve o'clock-not twelve o'clock on your heirloom clock, but twelve o'clock on the alarm clock. \"\r\nHung-chien had no words to answer. After losing the first round, he changed his target and said, \"Is the wool waistcoat tied? I am going to wear it out at this time. \"\r\nJou-chia said impatiently, \"No knot! If you want to wear it, buy it yourself. I've never seen anyone like you in nasty [4]! I've been busy for six days, so I'm not allowed to be happy for half a day. I'll look at your face when I come back. \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"You're the only one who's busy for six days. I'm not busy! Of course, when you are busy, you have a price. You have great skills and a backer, and you earn more money than me-\"\r\n\"Luckily, I will earn some money, otherwise I will really bully you to death. My aunt said that you bullied me and didn't wronged you at all. \"\r\nHung-chien slapped the table hard and said, \"Then go and ask Mrs.Li, your family's overseas representative, to come up and tell her to report your Auntie quickly.\"\r\n\"One day, I will report myself. I don't think there is a second man like you. They are annoying you and don't come to your door. That's enough. You still forbid me to see them. Do you really want me to cut off my six relatives? Your lonely temper shouldn't marry me, but it's a pity that there won't be a woman in the mud and a woman in the sky, otherwise it will be perfect for your spleen and stomach. Scared, to be honest, I see through you. My grandchildren have no power or influence, so they are annoying you; What Su Wenwan and Tang Xiaofu's father did you meet? If you don't crawl on all fours to pay your respects, I won't believe it. \"\r\nHung-chien trembled with anger and said, \"If you talk nonsense again, I'll call.\"",

After a pause, Hung-chien said, \"I'm afraid to go to my own house because of you! Isn't it enough to meet your aunt in your office every day? Since aunt is so good, you might as well go and not come back. \"\r\nJou-chia said to herself, \"She is nicer to me than you are, and my family is nicer than yours.\"\r\nHung-chien's answer was: \"sh-sh-sh-shaw!\"\r\nJou-chia said, \"Go ahead and pee. My family is better than yours. I insist on going back often, and you can't control me. \"\r\nHung-chien could do nothing about his wife's stubbornness. He glared at her for a long time, opened the door vigorously and ran into Li Ma. He pushed her down the stairs and said, \"Have you had enough eavesdropping? Go and talk, I'm not afraid of you. \" When he came back from the newspaper office, Jou-chia was already asleep and they didn't talk. Tomorrow will be the same. On the third day, Hung-chien couldn't help it. At breakfast, he smashed the chopsticks table, but Jou-chia still ignored it. Admitting defeat, Hung-chien first said, \"Are you dead?\" Jou-chia said, \"You're talking to me, aren't you? I'm not dead yet, so I won't let you be quiet! I'm watching you clap chopsticks and bowl, and how many skills you have. \" Hung-chien sighed, \"Sometimes, I really wish I couldn't beat you up.\" Jou-chia glanced at him and said, \"I don't think it's far away to hit me.\" In this way, the two men made peace. However, after a big quarrel, it is often necessary to make up for it. The man said, \"I wouldn't be angry because you said something.\" The woman said, \"Then why did you say that first?\" I can't figure it out. I may have a little fight with you.\r\nWhen Hung-chien arrived at the newspaper office, he met an acquaintance, Mrs.Shen, who had tea with Su Wenwan. At that time, Zhao Xinmei introduced her to the library to compile the supplement of Family and Women, and now she also compiles the supplement of Culture and Art.. She still smells the same in elegant demeanour, but her costume is not as French as when she first returned to China, and the French in her conversation has also decreased. She has met so many people in the past year that she forgot Hung-chien long ago and introduced herself to Hung-chien. She said with a charming voice, \"Yes! I remember! How time flies! You are still the same at that time, so I feel familiar. As for me, I am much older this year! Mr.Fang, you don't know how upset I am for everything! \" As usual, Hung-chien said that she was not old. She asked him if he had met Mrs.Cao recently. Hung-chien said he had met her in Hong Kong. She hit her neck and said, \"Oh, dear! Look how confused I am! I received a letter from Wen Wan last week, saying that I met you and had a good talk with you. She also asked me to do something for her. I am too busy to do it for her. I have so many miscellaneous things in a day! \" Hung-chien laughed at her for lying and asked her where Mr.Shen was.",
        "a9ab3c2e-b0ff-403a-9a33-2c16c93c9f33": "She said with a charming voice, \"Yes! I remember! How time flies! You are still the same at that time, so I feel familiar.

She raised her eyebrows, opened her eyes wide, pointed her finger at her mouth, and France was full of expression, and no one looked around. Then she whispered, \"He's hiding. He is so famous that the Japanese and the Nanjing puppet government all want to find him to work. Don't tell! \" Hung-chien held his breath and suffocated dangerously. He stepped back and repeatedly said \"Yes\". He went back to talk to Jou-chia, saying that the world is really small. After meeting Su Wenwan, he unexpectedly met her again. Jou-chia said coldly, \"Yes, the world is small. You will meet someone when you wait. \" Hung-chien didn't understand and asked who he met. Jou-chia said with a smile, \"Do I have to tell you? You know in your heart, don't burn the plate. \" Only then did he mean Tang Xiaofu and criticised him: \"What nonsense! I never dreamed of it. What if I meet her? \" Jou-chia said, \"Ask yourself.\" He sighed and said, \"Only you fool will never forget her! I have long forgotten that she may have married and become a mother and won't remember me. It's naive to think about taking love so seriously before marriage. To be honest, no matter who you marry, after you get married, you always find that you are not married to the original person, but to another one. If I had known this, I could have saved all the pursuit, love and so on before I got married. When falling in love, the two sides all converge, and they haven't recognized each other until they get married, but the old-fashioned marriage is simple, and no one knows anyone until they get married. \" Jou-chia said, \"Have you finished your discussion? I only have two words: first, you are heartless, and I still take love very seriously; Second, you are really your father's son, and you are becoming more and more stubborn. \" Hung-chien said, \"Why are you so heartless? Am I not very kind to you? Besides, my words are just general remarks. You are always stubborn and like to implicate yourself. You can also say that you didn't find my true colors before you got married, and now you know my truth. \" Jou-chia said, \"After talking nonsense for a long time, that's what I heard.\" Hung-chien said, \"You are very young. At my age, you will understand this.\" Jou-chia said, \"Don't sell old people, they are just over thirty! You won't live long if you sell old. I'm afraid I'll be angry with you before I'm thirty. \" Hung-chien smiled and said, \"Jou-chia, you are very civilized in everything. This sentence is out of date. It's also like the style of an old-fashioned woman threatening her husband with death, but instead of knives, ropes and arsenic, she uses abstract' qi'. Is this spiritual civilization? \" Jou-chia said, \"Bah! Die or die. Who are you threatening? Scare who? But don't be happy, I won't spare you. \" Hung-chien said, \"You're serious again! If you go on talking, you will quarrel. Go to sleep quickly. You have to go to the office early tomorrow morning. Close your eyes quickly. Good eyes, lack of sleep, swollen tomorrow, your aunt will come to question, \"said, patting her as if she were sleeping.\"",

If he really meets him, it must be the same. The reason is that I loved her a year ago and died long ago. I loved her, feared Su Wenwan, and was seduced by Miss Bao, and all of them died. There are a few dead themselves buried in their memories, and they set up epitaphs and tombs, and occasionally they mourn, like some feelings for Tang Xiaofu. There are a few people who seem to have been killed by the road, but they don't clean up, let them rot and melt, and be eaten by birds and animals-but they can't be eliminated all the time, such as themselves who buy diplomas from Irish people.\r\nHong gradually went to the newspaper for more than two months. One morning, he saw a notice in the newspaper that Mrs.Shen put her commonly used pen name, probably saying that she had always been committed to journalism and did not ask about politics. The legends about her were all shadows. He was shocked, and when he inquired in the newspaper office, he realized that her husband had been falsely employed and she had gone to Nanjing. Remembering what Hsin-mei had warned himself in Hong Kong, he wrote to report the incident and asked him if he was married and why he hadn't heard from him for a long time. He went home to discuss this matter with his wife, and she was sorry. However, she said, \"It's good that she's gone. I don't think her supplement is wonderful. What she wrote herself, today and tomorrow, will be moved around, and it will save trouble to keep saying those words. People who read the newspaper throw it away after reading it, and they won't find the old newspaper right. I don't want her to publish a collection, otherwise there is only one article in dozens, which is really a big joke. Like her, I will also compile Family and Women. You can make up \"Culture and Art\" for her. \" Hung-chien said, \"I'm not as confident as you are. Good wife, you don't know the pain of pulling a manuscript. I'll tell you honestly: I wrote the column \"Instructions for Housewives\" in \"Family and Women\", such as \"Soy sauce with sesame oil won't get moldy\" and so on. \" Jou-chia laughed until her stomach ached and said, \"I'm laughing to death! You know what soy sauce is topped with sesame oil! Did you learn from Li Ma? I have never paid attention. \" Hung-chien said, \"So you can't manage this family well. Mama Li should worship me as a husband! Mrs.Shen didn't have a manuscript, so she complained to me that my reference room should provide information. Afraid of smelling her, I promised her that I could let her go quickly. So I found an old housewife's handbook, copied seven or eight articles in each issue, and gave it to her without waiting for her to come. You don't have that smell. If you want to pull the manuscript, I will ignore you first. \" Jou-chia frowned and said, \"You don't speak well, which makes me sick. When you tell her this, she will surely take you to No.76 Huxi to be tortured. \" [5] His wife's joke made him suddenly serious and said:\r\n\"I don't think I can live here any longer. Now you understand why I didn't want to come. \"\r\nThree weeks later, on a Saturday, Hung-chien went home early. Jou-chia said, \"Zhao Xinmei has an express airmail letter.",

I thought it was something urgent. I opened it and read it. Sorry. \"\r\nHung-chien changed his slippers and said, \"He's got a letter! Show me quickly and say something? \"\r\n\"Busy with what? There is nothing urgent. He wrote an express letter to answer the bill, but I searched for your stamp for a long time, and the messenger hurried downstairs, so anxious! In the future, don't leave the stamp in the west, put it in a certain place, it will be easy to find. Is this the first time he has answered your letter since we returned to Shanghai? I thought it was true that there was no need to send an express letter and write more letters. \"\r\nHung-chien knew that she always had a grudge against Hsin-mei and ignored her. The letter is very simple. It says that all previous letters have been received. Mrs.Shen knows that the rivers in Shanghai are getting worse. Come to Chongqing quickly, or you can work in the same office. You can meet Manager Xue at the Shanghai office of the company that transferred luggage last time to discuss your travel companions. At the end of the letter, there is \"my wife asked me to pay my respects to your wife.\" He felt like he was groping in the dark and suddenly saw the light. He was happy, but he dared not show his face. He just said, \"This guy! Don't even notice you get married, and don't send a wedding photo. I'd like you to see this Mrs.Zhao. \"\r\n\"I don't see also want to come. I have seen all the women Hsin-mei likes, Mrs.Wang and Miss Su. I want to come to that school. \"\r\n\"That's not true. So I hope he will send a photo to show you. \"\r\n\"Let's wedding photos for him. It's not that I alienate you. I don't think your good friend cares about you. There were four or five letters when you went, right? He just scribbled such a letter and didn't inform you of his marriage. He is rich and has many friends; I've been you. I haven't received a reply to one letter, and I'll never go to the second one. \"\r\nHung-chien told her what was on her mind and stammered, \"You always like to exaggerate. I just wrote him three letters before and after. He didn't inform me of his marriage because he was afraid that I would give him a gift. He understands my poverty and knows that we have received his generous gift when we got married, and we must return the gift. \"\r\nJou-chia said quickly, \"Oh, that's the truth! Only you understand what he means. After all, we are good friends, knowing ourselves and ourselves! However, a happy event is no better than a funeral, and a gift can be made up. He should simply not mention the word' wife' in the letter. If you want to give a gift, it's time. \"\r\nBeing refuted, Hung-chien could only blackmail him: \"Then you can do it for me.\"\r\nJou-chia brushed her hair and said, \"I don't have time.\"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I'm still alone when I go out in the morning. How can I become a hedgehog at this time!\"\r\nJou-chia said, \"I am the hedgehog. Don't talk to the hedgehog.\"\r\nAfter a silence, Hedgehog spoke to himself: \"Hsin-mei's letter advised you to go to Chongqing. How do you reply to him?\"\r\nHung-chien muttered, \"I think I want to go, but I have to think it over.\"\r\n\"What about me?\"",
        "315ea8f5-a43c-4c14-b135-f049e392f1ae": "He should simply not mention the word' wife' in the letter.

Hung-chien knew that this was the silence before the storm.\r\n\"Just for you, I hesitated. As for Shanghai, I don't want to stay, and there is no way out in the newspaper office. Half of this family owes to you-\"Hung-chien thought this sentence could calm the air-\"Since Hsin-mei is well-intentioned, I really want to try my luck in it again. However, the matter has not yet been decided, and it is inconvenient to bring our families in. Of course, you remember the pain of looking for a house in Shanghai this time. Hsin-mei is a married man, not like before. I plan to go in alone, and I'll pick you up when I have a plan. What do you think? Of course, this will take a long-term view. I haven't decided. You might as well tell me your opinion. \" Hung-chien said this sentence, ready for her to cut it off at any time. I didn't know that she didn't say a word, so he said it. The silence made him more and more flustered.\r\n\"I'm listening to how many articles you do. Just tell the truth. After being married for four months, I'm tired of my ugly and fierce wife at home-I never loved her at all-and I have a chance to fly away. Why not have a fresh air? Your good friend is your savior. It's him who forced you to get married-I hate it when I think about it-and it's him who helped you regain your freedom. Go quickly! He promoted you to be an official, and maybe even found an official wife for you! We are not worthy of you. \"\r\nHung-chien said angrily, \"Where are you from? It's really neurotic. \"\r\n\"I'm not nervous at all. Go ahead, I will never detain you. Instead, let your friend say that I' tried my best' to marry a man, and I never let him relax, but let you say that my family is tired and delayed your future. Well, I'm not! I eat my own food, and I have never asked you to raise it. I am not tired of your family. It's up to you whether you come back or not when you go this time. \"\r\nHung-chien sighed, \"Well-\"Jou-chia waited for him to say, \"I won't go,\" but he said-\"I'll take you with me. That's always good.\"\r\n\"I have a good job here, why throw it away for no reason to go with you. When we get inside, if neither of us can find a job, can we really ask Hsin-mei to support our family? If you have something to do and I have nothing to do, then you don't know how to bully people! Hsin-mei didn't say anything about promoting me in his letter. What am I going in for? Make a vase? Too ugly to qualify. Unless you serve the official wife as a big momma. \"\r\n\"Damn it! Damn it! I'm not bullying you. You are always more capable and earn more money than me. Now you know that you are relying on the face of your relatives here, and you may not find anything in the mainland? \"\r\n\"I rely on relatives, and you? Not as reliable as relatives. With your friends, aren't we just each other? And I never said that I am more capable than you, but you are dirty and can't swallow that I earn more money than you. What about the mainland?

I regret listening to you, and I wrote to Gao Songnian in Hengyang to thank him. I must have laughed him to death. I won't listen to you in the future. Do you really want to keep you because Gao Songnian gave you a letter of appointment? Don't be too proud, he is messing with me! You fool! \"\r\n\"Anyway, you listen to everyone, especially Zhao Xinmei than imperial edict Turin, is I don't listen.

He really wants to keep you and let the students beat down Miss Sung again. \"\r\nJou-chia blushed like a cockfighting crown, and her eyes were red. After a pause, she said, \"I'm a young girl, just graduated from college, and it's the first time I've done something. I'm not embarrassed to be bullied by those dog boys and students. Unlike someone who comes back from studying abroad to teach, it is still my news to show the students to get rid of them, and to save his job. \"\r\nHung-chien had hundreds of words, and he blurted them out at the same time, but he couldn't say a word. Jou-chia said before he could speak, \"I'm going to sleep.\" She went into the bathroom to rinse her mouth and wash her face, and closed the door behind her. When she came out, Hung-chien would continue to quarrel. She said, \"I won't argue with you. What's the use of talking more when feelings are bad in this field? Let's talk less and leave some room. If you want to make a noise, you can make a noise; I washed my mouth and stopped talking. \" Say that finish, she jumped into bed, covered the quilt, got up and opened the drawer, found two cotton balls in her ears, lay down, closed her eyes and slept quietly, and snored for a while, like sleeping soundly. Her husband hated pulling her up and forcing her to argue with himself, so he had to punch her on the body. She saw everything under her eyelashes, laughing angrily and snigger. Tomorrow night, when Hung-chien comes back, she cooks orange cheese and waits for him. Hung-chien was so angry that he refused to eat it. He couldn't help but be greedy. While eating, he scolded himself for not living up to expectations. She said, \"Have you written Hsin-mei's letter?\" He said, \"No, I won't answer his letter, good wife.\" She said, \"It's not that I forbid you to go. I advise you not to be rash. Hsin-mei is very enthusiastic and I know it. However, he has a problem, he often promises in front of him, but in fact he can't. You've had experience.

What's more, this time it was his personal letter, but generally speaking, is it possible to ask for something? \" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"You really do everything possible.

What's more, this time it was his personal letter, but generally speaking, is it possible to ask for something? \" Hung-chien said with a smile, \"You really do everything possible. You are resourceful and endless. Fortunately, he is a man. If he is a woman, I can't think of how you are more jealous? \" Jou-chia was slightly embarrassed, but she smiled easily. \"Isn't it good to be jealous of you? If he were a woman, would he care about you? He will associate with you? You are really dreaming! Only me, I was scolded by you yesterday, and I still want to please you today. \"\r\nThe newspaper office received threatening letters and warnings from the concession authorities in order to make fierce remarks. There is a legend in the office that the American lawyer who came forward as the publisher is unwilling to lend his name to the newspaper office, that Mr.Wang, the editor-in-chief, has fallen out with the shareholders, and that Mrs.Shen has arranged for the enemy and puppet to buy it off. Hung-chien got along well with Mr.Wang. Hearing all these rumors, he went to ask him and showed him Hsin-mei's letter. Mr.Wang took it very seriously, but advised Hung-chien not to resign for the time being. He himself was striving for the management for the editorial policy, and it would be known soon. Hung-chien said generously, \"I'll leave the day your husband leaves.\" Mr.Wang said, \"If we agree, we will stay; if we disagree, we will go. This is everyone's freedom, I dare not force you. However, Hsin-mei entrusted you to me. I will definitely tell you what I have done and I will never hide anything from you. \" Hung-chien went back and didn't say a word to Jou-chia. He felt that he couldn't do anything according to his original intention as soon as he discussed it with her for half a year, and he was very unhappy. This time, he just made up his mind alone, and many children took the pleasure of adults stealing and doing bad things. Jou-chia knew that he hadn't answered Hsin-mei's letter, and she thought she had been persuaded by influence.\r\nOn the morning before the winter solstice in the Chinese calendar, Jou-chia was just about to go out when Hung-chien said, \"Don't forget, we're going to our old home for winter solstice dinner today. Yesterday, the old man called himself to tell you, so you can't stop going. \" Jou-chia wrinkled her nose and made an expression of disgust. \"Go, go, go!\" Ugly daughter-in-law meets in-laws!' I really care about you. I don't have to go today. You refused to accompany me to the banquet at my aunt's house the night before. Why should I accompany you today? \"Hung-chien laughed at her for taking sugar as vinegar. Jou-chia said, \"I want to talk to you. Otherwise, you still think you should take advantage of me. I'll come home and go with you when you come back. I won't go alone. \" Hung-chien said, \"It's not the first time for the bride to visit, so why do you want me to take an extra trip?\" Jou-chia went out without answering. Shortly after she went out, Mr.Wang called and asked him to go at once. He guessed that something had happened, and his heart was pounding, anxious and afraid to know. When Mr.Wang met him, he said with a wry smile, \"The board of directors approved my resignation last night. Whenever I leave the library, they have already found a replacement. I want to make an account tomorrow and let you know first.\" Hung-chien said, \"Then I resign from you today-I was appointed by you-should I resign in writing?\" Mr.Wang said, \"Why don't you go and discuss it with your old man?\" Hung-chien said, \"This is my personal matter.\" Mr.Wang is an honest man.",

He was forced to leave this time for justice. He likes to go lively, reduce the sadness of leaving his job, and refuses to run away like an elopement. After joining the WTO for many years, he understands that in all organs, there are always people to replace and people to sit in their seats. If you resign, you will only suffer, and the resigned position will be indifferent. People refuse to sit in a chair, and their legs suffer. If the chair is empty, they will not be hungry, and if the chair is standing, their legs will not be sore. However, more empty chairs can create the impression of depression. Although Hung-chien is not his personal, the more, the better. We might as well make up a sum. So he resigned with the editors of domestic news, foreign news, economic news and two supplements at the same time. Newspaper management has long been prepared for this, and there are plenty of people in the bag; And know that this resignation is political, I hope they will leave soon, so as not to cause complications. Anyway, this month's salary has already been paid. Except for the editor of economic news, all the resignation letters sent by Mr.Wang were accurate one by one. The reference room is the least important and can be replaced at any time, so Hung-chien was the first to lose his job and was the first to resign. In the afternoon, when his father-in-law heard the news, he came to ask him if Jou-chia agreed to this matter. He casually said that she agreed. My father-in-law is disgruntled. Hung-chien thought that he wouldn't come tomorrow, and many things had to be finished. He called Jou-chia and said that he didn't have time to go home with him today. Please ask her to go directly, without waiting. I could hear on the phone that she was very unhappy. Hung-chien couldn't explain it because his father-in-law suddenly came again.\r\nHe didn't get to his hometown until nearly seven o'clock, and he regretted not calling to ask Jou-chia if she had left. She probably wouldn't come alone. When everyone saw him and asked why he came alone, his mother said with a livid face, \"Your grandmother is really an honorable person and doesn't come to the next post.\" Hung-chien was explaining that Jou-chia came in. Second Daughter-in-law and Third Daughter-in-law greeted her and said with a smile, \"What a rare visitor!\" Mrs.Fang barely smiled, as if laughing hurt her face. Jou-chia used the excuse of being busy. Third Daughter-in-law said, \"Of course, people who work outside are much busier than us.\" The second grandmother said, \"We have to work for a certain period of time, eldest brother and third brother, and our second child also works outside, and we don't stay home all day. Big sister does things and does housework, so she can't spare time to see us. \" Hung-chien, because they all talked like Zen meditation, kept their heads hidden, and when they listened to the nonsense, they sneaked upstairs to see their father. Within three sentences, Jou-chia came, said hello to Tun-weng, exchanged a few pleasantries, and couldn't help blaming her husband. \"Now I know why you didn't come home to pick me up. Why did you resign from the newspaper office without consulting me first? Even if I'm not sensible, at least you should come here first and ask dad. \" Tun-weng didn't hear his son say he resigned, but he lost his voice and asked in surprise. Embarrassed, Hung-chien said, \"I was just about to tell Dad-how-how did you know?\" Jou-chia said, \"Dad called me, and you still coax him! He didn't even quit.",

Why did you quit in a hurry and wait and see the limelight? \" Hung-chien quickly defended himself. Tun-Weng also blamed his son for his recklessness, but he refused to collapse him in front of his daughter-in-law. Anyway, things were irreparable, so he said, \"In that case, it's good that you quit. People like us should never be greedy for small profits and forget the righteousness. I would rather escape as a refugee than go back to my hometown, just for this little integrity. When you first entered the newspaper office, I disapproved of it, thinking it was worse than teaching. Come tomorrow, let's discuss it, and I'll find a way out for you. \" Jou-chia stopped talking and kept a straight face. At dinner, Mrs.Fang urged Hung-chien to eat vegetables, saying, \"You've lost weight recently, and your face is not moist at all. What do you eat at home? Jou-chia is too busy to be careful of you. Why don't you come here for dinner? I have eaten my own cooking since I was a child, and I have not poisoned you. \" Jou-chia bowed her head and tried to restrain herself. After half a bowl of rice, she refused to eat it. Seeing that her daughter-in-law's face didn't look easy to deal with, Mrs.Fang didn't dare to provoke her again, only comforting herself that her daughter-in-law didn't dare to answer back.\r\nOn the way home, Hung-chien repeatedly apologized for his mother. Jou-chia simply said, \"You did what she said and didn't say anything for me. I learned another good one. \" As soon as she got home, she complained of a stomachache and asked Li Ma to warm her stomach with a hot water bottle. Mama Li asked quickly, \"How did you eat badly, Miss?\" She said that eating is not bad, and she is angry. In normal times, Hung-chien must blame her for telling the employer about her master. Today, he dare not. Jou-chia ignored him that night, and there was still silence between the couple tomorrow morning. At breakfast, Li Ma asked Hung-chien what he wanted for lunch today. Hung-chien said that he was going to his hometown on business and might not come back for dinner, so she didn't have to cook. Jou-chia sneered, \"Mama Li, you can save trouble in the future. My uncle never eats at home from now on, and their old lady said you put poison in your dish. \"\r\nHung-chien frowned and said, \"Alas! Why do you have to tell her-\"\r\nJou-chia weighed the leather shoes on her right foot and said, \"I have to tell her.\" Mama Li is here as a witness, and I want to make it clear. From then on, if you kill me, I will never come to your house again. When I'm dead, you'll ask people to make a soup for me, and my ghost won't come-\"When it comes to tears, Hung-chien is heartbroken and stands up to comfort him. She pushes him away-\"Besides, let's stay out of it, and you don't have to tell me anything about you. We all want to be traitors, and only your domestic dogs understand the righteousness. \" Say that finish, turned around and walked, humming English songs all the way downstairs, indicating that she didn't care.\r\nHung-chien was depressed, and he was too lazy to go to his hometown. Tun Weng called to urge him. He went to listen to Tun Weng's talk for a long time, and there was no practical instruction or help. He hated everyone in his family and refused to sit more.",

I came out and went to the manager of that transshipment company to ask about the travel expenses. I didn't meet him and made an appointment to go again tomorrow. Go to Mr.Wang's house and find a time. At this time, the tram was full of people from the office. He couldn't squeeze in, so he walked home, trying to find a way to relieve Jou-chia's resentment. When I saw a car in the mouth, I realized that it belonged to the Lujia family, and my heart was awkward. Open the back door and pass through the kitchen shared with the landlord. Li Ma is not here, and the canned food stewed on the stove can't talk to herself. When he reached the half floor, the door of the small guest room opened and Mrs.Lu spoke loudly. He was so angry that he didn't want to go in, and his feet seemed to be nailed. She was just saying, \"Hung-chien has no skills, but he has a big temper. I know that, and I don't need Li Ma to tell him. Jou-chia, a man, like a child, can't be spoil [6]. You are too obedient to him-\"His blood rose to his face, wishing he couldn't throw himself into it with a big drink. Suddenly he heard Li Ma's footsteps and came downstairs. He was afraid of being seen by her, so he slipped out of the door quietly. I'm so angry that I forget the cold wind. I don't know when this disgusting woman will leave, so I just don't go back for dinner. Anyway, I'm going to beg after I lose my job, so I don't have to save it for these small money. After walking a few roads, my anger subsided. Passing a foreign bakery, the lights in the kitchen window are bright and shine on all kinds of cakes. An old man in rags stood outside the window, staring at the things in the window, holding a basket on his arm, holding a rough clay doll and a sticky wax paper. Hung-chien thinks that all the children in the city now don't want such stupid toys. There are plenty of exquisite foreign goods. Poor old man won't have business. I suddenly think that I am like a toy in his basket. Nobody asks me these days, so it is so difficult to find a job. With a sigh, he took out the purse from Jou-chia and gave the old man two bills. Two little beggars waiting for guests to come out to beg for money at the bakery door caught up with him and asked for money, and followed him for a long time. He was so hungry that he chose a cheap Russian restaurant and was about to go in. He reached into his pocket and touched it. His wallet disappeared, and he was so anxious that he sweated slightly in the cold wind. It was too meager to be a sweat, just like emotional steam. What a unlucky day today! I had to go home, and I didn't have the money to take the tram. A wave of resentment was all on Jou-chia. If Mrs.Lu doesn't come, she will never go out to eat the cold wind, and she won't lose her purse if she doesn't go out to the street. Mrs.Lu is Jou-chia's aunt and Jou-chia invited her to the house-Jou-chia will wronged her if she doesn't invite her. And his money has always been left in his pockets,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTouch an empty pocket with your hand at most, put it in with your purse and pour it.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvenient hands, this is all Jou-chia's good idea.",

Li Ma had never seen him go home with such a straight face and watched him out of the kitchen anxiously. Jou-chia saw it was him, put down her newspaper, stood up and said, \"You're back! Is it cold outside? Where did you have dinner? We'll eat when you don't come back. \"\r\nHung-chien was ready to go home for dinner, and when he knew that the meal had been eaten, he felt a sense of satisfaction in his disappointment, as if it had laid a solid foundation for his anger. Today, there was a loud quarrel and he said calmly, \"I don't have any relatives to eat for free, of course I didn't eat.\"\r\nJou-chia said in surprise, \"Then, tell Mama Li to go shopping quickly. That's terrible! I ran out of cookies at home the day before yesterday. I forgot to buy them. I didn't want to give you anything hungry! Where have you been? Tell us to wait! My aunt came to see you. If you don't come, I'll keep her for dinner! \"\r\nHung-chien, like a drowning man, grabbed one end of the rope and hung on it with all his strength, saying, \"Oh! There she is! No wonder! People ate my rice, but I didn't eat it myself. It's kind of her to come to see me. I didn't invite her! I won't go to her door. Why did she go to mine? My aunt wants to stay for dinner, and my husband should starve. Ok, weigh your heart, I will be hungry for one day and don't want Li Ma to go shopping. \"\r\nJou-chia sat down, picked up the newspaper and said, \"I regret ignoring you, you ungrateful bastard.\" It's none of my business if you want to starve. The newspaper office won't go again. What are you busy with outside? Don't come back until then! I pay half of the expenses at home, and I have the right to treat you, which is none of your business. Moreover, Li Ma's cooking is poisonous, so you'd better eat less. \"\r\nHung-chien's anger swelled with anger, and his stomach stung. He had no pocket money with him. He wanted to go to the bank to get it tomorrow, but at this time he refused to ask Jou-chia for it, saying, \"Anyway, I'm starving. You're happy. Your good aunt will find a good husband for you. \"\r\nJou-chia sneered, \"Hey! I think you are crazy. If you are hungry, you can be clear-headed when you are hungry. \"\r\nHung-chien's anger came up like the second tide and said, \"Is this the secret that your good aunt taught you? Jou-chia, men can't be too lazy. They spoil starve him, freeze him and abuse him.' \"\r\nJou-chia studied her husband's face carefully and said, \"Oh, so the old maid at the landlord's house said she saw you coming back. Why not go upstairs aboveboard? Sneaking around like a thief, hiding halfway up the stairs and eavesdropping on people. This kind of thing is only suitable for your two brothers and daughters-in-law, thanks to your being a big man! Shame? \"\r\nHung-chien said, \"I want to hear it, or I really don't know how people are ruining me behind my back.\"\r\n\"How can we spoil you? Why don't you say? \"",

They said, \"It wasn't meant for you. Who taught you to eavesdrop? Let me ask you something. My aunt said that she would find you a place in the factory. Did your sharp ears hear that? \"\r\nHung-chien jumped up and shouted, \"Who wants her to find something for me? I beg and don't beg from her! Isn't it enough that she has two stooges, Bobby and Sun Roujia? You tell her that Fang Hung-chien's' skills are lacking, but he has a big temper', and the lackeys of capitalists will not do it. \"\r\nThe two stood opposite each other. Jou-chia's eyes were unusually bright with anger and said, \"There is nothing wrong with what she said. People pity you. If you don't want your job, it won't get moldy. Well, your father will' find your way' for you. However, relying on the old man is not surprising, and he has the ability to find his own way. \"\r\n\"I don't rely on anyone. I tell you, I have sent a telegram to Zhao Xinmei today, and I just told all the people in the forwarding company. After I went, you were so quiet that you could not only stay with your aunt for dinner, but also stay with her for the night. Or simply move to her house and let her raise you, just like Bobby. \"\r\nJou-chia's upper and lower lips differentiated, her eyes widened, and after listening, she gritted her teeth and said, \"OK, let's call it a break. Do the luggage and clothes yourself, and don't come to me again. Last year, you had nothing to do in Shanghai, and you followed Zhao Xinmei to the mainland. The mainland affairs were lost. You were promoted to Shanghai by Zhao Xinmei, and the Shanghai affairs were lost again. Now you are going to the mainland to join Zhao Xinmei. Think for yourself, follow him all your life and bite his clothes. What is it if you are not his lackey? Not only do you have no skills, but you also have no ambition. Don't tell me about integrity. Be careful not to annoy your friend, kick you out, and then go back to Shanghai to see what face you have. I don't care whether you go or not. \"\r\nHung-chien couldn't stand it any longer, and said, \"Then, please don't speak again.\" He reached out his right hand and shoved her chest. She stumbled back and bumped into the table. Her arm brought a glass to the ground, and the glass crumbs were mixed in the water. She panted and said, \"Did you hit me? You hit me! \" Li Ma, whose clothes were thick, burst into a cotton bomb and shouted, \"Uncle, how did you hit someone?\"? If you want to fight, I'll scream. Let all downstairs hear-miss, where did he hit you, and did he hurt you? Don't be afraid, I'll fight him for my life. Be a man and hit a woman! The old lady didn't hit you.

Hung-chien saw that she was crying piteously, rather than piteously, and hated her for deepening. Li Ma sheltered Jou-chia by the sofa and said, \"Miss, don't cry! I'm going to cry if you cry-\"and then I pulled up my apron to wipe my tears-\"Look, you beat her like this! Miss, I really want to tell my aunt, and I am afraid that if I go, he will hit you again. \"\r\nHung-chien snapped, \"Ask your young lady if I hit her? Go and ask your aunt, and I won't hit your young lady! \" Half-pushing and half-shoving, Li Ma was pushed straight out of the room. In less than a minute, she rushed in again and said, \"Miss, I asked the landlord's eldest lady to call my aunt for me. She will come right away. We are not afraid of him!\" Hung-chien and Jou-chia didn't expect her to take it seriously, but they were still hostile at this time and couldn't jointly blame her for much trouble. Jou-chia forgot to cry, and Hung-chien looked at Mama Li in surprise, as if a child had seen a monster in the zoo. After a moment of silence, Hung-chien said, \"OK, I'll leave when she comes. It's not enough for you two women to form a party. You need to add another one. Speaking of it, my man bullied you and I'll come back when she leaves.\" Get your coat from the hanger.\r\nJou-chia didn't want her aunt to make a big deal out of it, but seeing her husband retreat like this, she was so contemptuous that she was no longer sad. She hissed, \"You are a Coward! Coward\uff01 Coward\uff01 [7] I never want to see you Coward again! \" Every word is like a whip to whip out her husband's courage, but she is not hard enough, so she grabbed an ivory comb on the table and threw it at him as hard as she could. Hung-chien was about to turn his head to answer, but he couldn't dodge. The comb struck his left cheek hard, and it burst onto the floor, breaking it in two. Jou-chia only heard his \"ouch\" cry for pain. When she hit the comb, her blood was faintly red and swollen, but she repented and was afraid, ready for him to fight back. Li Ma was busy stopping between two people. Hung-chien was appalled that she would be so vicious. Seeing that her desk stood still, her tearful face was like dying embers, her eyes were all red, her nostrils were open, and her mouth swallowed, which was pitiful and terrible. At the same time, she heard footsteps coming upstairs, so she ignored it and said, \"You are cruel! You make your family not know enough, but also make your neighbors know all about it. At this time, the landlord's family has heard it. You've learned to be provocative and lose face. I still want to be a man, but I lose face. I'm leaving.

You saw with your own eyes who hit who. \" Go to the door and say loudly, \"I'm going out,\" and slowly turn the knob to let the eavesdropper outside the door get the message to go away and go out. Jou-chia watched him go out of the room and collapsed on the sofa, holding his head and crying. This burst of tears didn't just come from his eyes, just like tears were squeezed out of his heart and whole body to vent.\r\nWhen Hung-chien walked out of the door, his nerves were numb and he didn't feel cold. Only his left cheek was burning in his mind. In my mind, my thoughts are filled with confusion, like a sky with snow in the north wind. He walked on his feet, and the street lamps that stayed up all night handed his shadow to each other one by one. He seems to have another self saying, \"it's over!\" It's over! \" The scattered thoughts immediately gathered like a pinch and began to feel sad. Suddenly, the stars ached in his left cheek. When he felt wet and greasy, he thought it was blood, and his heart sank with fear, and his legs went soft. I walked under the lamp and saw that there was no trace on my finger, so I knew I had shed tears. At the same time, I feel tired and hungry. Hung-chien instinctively reached into his pocket to wait for a peddler to buy a loaf of bread, and suddenly remembered that he had no money on him. Hungry people get angry, but the fire burns like paper and won't last. He had nowhere to go, so he wanted to go home and sleep. He was not afraid of Mrs.Lu when he met her. Even if she did it first, Jou-chia retaliated so viciously that she wrote it off twice. He looked at his watch and saw that it was past ten o'clock. He didn't know when he came out. Maybe she had already left. I didn't see the car when I arrived at the mouth, so I was relieved first As soon as he entered the door, the landlady heard the voice and came to say, \"Mr.Fang, it's you!\" Your housewife is not feeling well, so she took Li Ma to Lujia and won't come back today. This is the key to your room. I left it for you. Come to my house for breakfast tomorrow, and Li Ma will tell me. \" Hung-chien's heart sank and he couldn't get it. He mechanically took the key and thanked him. The landlady seemed to have something to say. He fled upstairs in three steps. Open the bedroom door, turn on the light, the broken cup and comb are still in the same place, and one of the piles of boxes is missing. He stood in a daze, too dull to be anxious and angry. Jou-chia left, but her angry face, her crying and her words still remained in this room, and they did not disappear in the air. He saw a film on the table and took a closer look. It belonged to Mrs.Lu. Suddenly angry, torn to pieces, malicious track: \"well, you are very free, leave me!\" Fuck you, roll for me, all of you roll for me! \" This brief anger exhausted all my strength, and I was too weak to cry. I fell on the bed with my clothes and felt the house spinning, and I couldn't think of it! Never get sick! I'm going to see the manager tomorrow, and I'll raise the travel expenses after the agreement, so I can spend the old calendar year in Chongqing. Hope is born again in my heart, like wet firewood that doesn't catch fire and starts to smoke. It seems that everything will work out.",

Hope is born again in my heart, like wet firewood that doesn't catch fire and starts to smoke. It seems that everything will work out. Unconsciously, the sky was closed and wrapped in darkness, like the night when all the lights went out, and he fell asleep. At first, he slept crisp and thin, and hunger was like tweezers to break his coma, and his subconscious blocked it. Gradually, the tweezers became loose and dull, and his sleep was so solid that the tweezers could not be broken. There was no dream and no feeling. The most primitive sleep in life was also a dead sample.\r\nThe old ancestral clock struck at ease, as if it had saved half a day. When it was dead of night, it was moved out and counted one by one: \"Dang, Dang, Dang, Dang, Dang\" rang six times. Six o'clock was five hours ago. At that time, when Hung-chien was walking on his way home, he was careful to be kind to Jou-chia and advised her not to upset the couple about yesterday. At that time, Jou-chia waited at home for Hung-chien to come back for dinner, hoping that he would make up with his aunt and work in her factory. This outdated timing inadvertently contains satire and sadness about life, which is deeper than all languages and all smiles."
