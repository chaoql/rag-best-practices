The Red Sea is long past. The ship was sailing in the Indian Ocean. But the sun is still unforgiving, setting late and rising early, encroaching on most of the night. Night as if the paper soaked in oil, into a translucent body; it to the sun embraced, can not be divided out of the body, perhaps to the sun intoxicated, so the sunset sunset fade after the night color also with flushed red. To the red fade drunkenness wake up, the cabin sleeper also woke up all sweaty, took a shower and rushed to the deck to blow the sea breeze, another day began. It was late July, the hottest time of the year in the old Chinese calendar. In China, the heat was even more favorable than usual, and everyone said afterwards that it was a sign of war, because it was the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China [1937].
This French mail boat, the Vicomte de Bragelonne, was on its way to China. At eight o'clock in the morning, the hosed-down third-class deck was still wet, but it was already full of people, French, Jews exiled from Germany, Indians, Annamites, and, needless to say, Chinese. The sea breeze contained a dry heat, and the fat bodies of the people were dried by the hot wind and covered with a layer of sweaty salt cream, as if they had just bathed in the Dead Sea of Palestine. After all, it was early in the morning, people's interest has not yet given the sun withered, baked laziness, talk and do things are very energetic. The Frenchmen, who had been sent to Annam or the Chinese Concession as policemen, were flirting around the young, pampered Jewish woman. Bismarck once said, French ministers and ambassadors, is characterized by a foreign language can not speak; these police do not know German, but actually conveyed the meaning of the Jewish woman, attracted the giggle, much better than their diplomats. The woman's beautiful husband, in the side of the happy, because he a few days, cigarettes, beer, lemonade stained a lot. The Red Sea has passed, not afraid of the heat of the fire, so wait a while on the deck of the sporadic peel, paper, corks outside, cigarette butts will be everywhere. French people's thinking is famously clear, their articles also understand clean, but their work, not chaotic, dirty, noisy, but look at the mess on this ship. This ship, relying on human ingenuity, full of human disturbances, full of human hopes, bustling along, every minute to stain the popularity of a small part of the water, back to the relentless, endless, boundless sea.
As usual, every summer a group of Chinese students return home after completing their studies. There were about ten of them on this boat. Most of them are young people who have not yet found a job, and they return to China at the beginning of the summer vacation so that they can look for a job with ease. Those who were not worried about anything would not be willing to go back to China until the fall. On the boat, there are those who studied in France, those who studied in England, Germany, Belgium, etc., and went to Paris to increase the experience of night life, so they also took the French boat. They met at the end of the world, like friends at first sight, talking about the motherland of the external and internal turmoil, all hate to go back immediately to serve it. The boat went so slow, everyone a piece of the countryside, is worried about nowhere to send, I do not know where suddenly came two sets of mahjong tiles. Mahjong is of course a national skill, and I have heard that it is popular in the United States; not only does it have a hometown flavor, but it is also suitable for the world trend. The number of people can be put together into two tables and have more than enough, so in addition to eating and sleeping, they gamble all day long for fun. Just after breakfast, the dining room below was already busy with the first round of cards, and the only people visible on deck were two Chinese women and a small child who didn't amount to a human being - at least the shipping company didn't treat him as a human being and didn't ask his parents to buy a replacement ticket for him. The woman with the sunglasses and the novel spread out on her body was extremely well-dressed. Skin in the Orient, to be considered white, but unfortunately this white is not fresh, with some dry stagnation. She had removed her dark glasses, and her eyebrows were clear, but her lips were too thin, and the lipstick was not rich enough. If she stood up from the canvas recliner, she would look thin, perhaps the lines of her silhouette were too hard, like the strokes of a square-tipped fountain pen. She looked twenty-five or twenty-six years old, but the age of a new school woman is like the age of an old-fashioned woman's wedding invitation, which requires what the expert scientist calls extrinsic evidence to determine its authenticity, and which cannot be seen by itself. The boy's mother has thirty outside, wearing a half old black cheongsam, full of labor and tiredness, coupled with the natural upside down eyebrows, the more sad and pathetic. The child is less than two years old, collapsed nose, two slits in the eyes, eyebrows high above, and eyes far away from each other to suffer from lovesickness, like the Chinese face in the newspaper caricature. He had just begun to walk, and was constantly running about; his mother held a leash on him, and pulled him back when he could not run more than three or four steps. His mother, who was afraid of the heat, was tired of pulling him, but she was also concerned about her husband's success down there and couldn't stop scolding the boy for being a nuisance. The child could not run anywhere, so he changed his purpose and pounced on the woman who was reading a book. The woman usually has a kind of lonely, fall hard to fit the look - a big banquet no one perfunctory guests or wedding banquet on the outdated unmarried girls often look - at this moment even more exudes disgust, dark glasses can not cover. The child's mother felt a little, and pulled her belt apologetically, “You naughty boy, going to make trouble with Miss Sue! Come back quickly. --Miss Su, you're so studious! Learning so well, but also read books all day long. Mr. Sun often told me that only a female student like Miss Su can win face for China, she is beautiful and has a doctorate, where can we find such a person? Like us, we came to a foreign country once for nothing, never read a word, and spent our whole lives as housekeepers, studying at home and forgetting all about giving birth to children! What a nuisance! I told you not to go; you don't do good work, and will certainly soil Miss Su's clothes.”
Miss Su has always despised this shabby Mrs. Sun, and least of all children, but hearing these words, her heart was happy, and she laughed peacefully and said, “Let him come, I like children best.” She took off her sunglasses, closed the book on the out-of-phase, carefully holding the small child's wrist, so as not to rub it on his own clothes, and asked him, “Where's daddy?” The little child didn't answer, and opened his eyes wide to Miss Sue “Bo! Bo!” Blowing spit, like the goldfish in the dining room blowing bubbles. Miss Su panicked and let go of her hand, pulling out her handkerchief in self-defense. Her mother was busy pulling him back, yelling that she was going to hit him in the mouth, and sighed: “His father is down there gambling, needless to say! I don't understand why all men love to gamble, look at the few of us on the same boat, none of us don't gamble like hell. Winning a few bucks is not a bad thing. Like our Mr. Sun lost a lot of money, but still want to gamble, hate me!”
Miss Su listened to the last few sentences of the small family words, can not help but heart to Mrs. Sun again despise, coldly said: “Mr. Fang is not gambling.”
Mrs. Sun's nostrils turned to the sky, out of cold air, “Mr. Fang! He also played cards when he got off the ship. Now he is busy pursuing Ms. Bao, of course he can't spare the time. People's lifelong affairs are much more important than gambling. I don't see what's so beautiful about Miss Bao's dark and thick appearance that would make Mr. Fang leave his second-class cabin and come to the third-class cabin to suffer. I think the two of them are going to be very good friends. Maybe they will get engaged when the ship arrives in Hong Kong. This is really a 'meeting of destiny'.”
