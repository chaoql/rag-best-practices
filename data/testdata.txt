Miss Su's scolding of Fang Hongjian for being shameless is truly unjustified. At that time, he was so embarrassed that it seemed like everyone on the deck was paying attention to him, blaming Miss Bao for being too capable and wishing he could say a few words to her. Although he is now 27 years old and has been engaged to a marriage before, he has no romantic training. My father was a juren from the Former Qing Dynasty and grew up to be a gentleman in a small county in Jiangnan, my hometown. Nine out of ten people from their county reside in major cities and work in three industries: making iron, grinding tofu, and carrying sedan chairs. The most famous local art form is clay dolls; Young people are most likely to study civil engineering when they enter university. The iron is hard, the tofu is bland and tasteless, the capacity of the sedan chair is small, and it is also filled with mud and earth, which is their way of life. Even those who become wealthy and officials lack generosity. There is a man surnamed Zhou in this county who opened a railway shop in Shanghai and made a fortune. He also organized a small bank called "Dianjin Bank" with his fellow townsmen in the same industry, and was honored to be the manager himself. He remembered the idiom 'Returning home in glory'. One year, during the Qingming Festival, he went back to the county to worship temples and sweep tombs, and met local people. Fang Hongjian's father was the leader of the village, and Manager Zhou often visited him, so he became friends and climbed from friends to relatives. Hung chien is still in high school and has decided to get engaged with his family. My fianc é e did not meet in person, only took a half body photo and was indifferent. Two years later, I went to Beiping to enter university and experienced the flavor of male and female classmates for the first time. Watching people fall in love with each other, don't be envious. Remembering that my fianc é e had been studying in high school for a year, so she didn't go to school and was interning at home to do household chores. When she got married and became a capable daughter-in-law, I couldn't help but hate her. After complaining about fate and father for a few days, I suddenly realized and bravely wrote a letter to my home demanding termination of the contract. He was once taught Chinese by Laozi and achieved second place in the high school entrance examination, so this belief in literature is not lacking, and he did not use it incorrectly. What did the letter say: "Recently, I have been touched by emotions and feelings, with little joy in Yin, embracing drama with autumn atmosphere. Every time I hold the mirror, I reflect on myself, with a cold and sharp appearance, and a clear and lifeless appearance. I am afraid that if I do not read it, Ms. Zhou may be delayed for life. I hope that you will empathize with me, be good at resolving the bell, and not be too reluctant to bear it and end up with eternal hatred." He thought that the wording of this letter was poignant and could move a heart of stone. Who knew that Father Kuaixin would come and scold her harshly: "I spare no expense to send you on a thousand mile journey, but you are too busy studying and have no spare time to look at the mirror? You are not a woman, why do you need a mirror? Only a child of a pear orchard, as a husband, looks at the mirror and is despised by the world. I do not expect you to be exposed to bad habits as soon as you leave your knees, which is lamentable and hateful! And with your parents around, you are not good at being tall and distant. You are frightened by death, unfilial, and extreme in this situation! As male and female students in your school, you are moved by the sight of your appearance and think differently; you use the excuse of mourning autumn, I know that you are truly... Huaichun, I cannot escape the old man's insight. If I persist in my mistake without regret, I will stop sending money and order you to take a leave of absence from school and return home, and marry your younger brother at the same time next year. Think carefully about my words and be cautious!" Fang Hongjian was half scared, not expecting the old man to be so shrewd. Busy writing a reply to beg for mercy and explain, saying: The mirror belongs to a fellow student and he did not buy it; I have been taking American cod liver oil pills and German vitamin pills these days, and my body and mind have improved, and my face has become fuller. Unfortunately, the price of the medicine is too high, and I cannot bear the money; As for the wedding ceremony, it should be held after graduation. On the one hand, it will hinder his studies, and on the other hand, he cannot support his family, which will burden his father and make him feel uneasy. His father received this letter, proving that his authority extended thousands of miles away and he was extremely proud. He was overjoyed and sent a sum of money to his son to buy tonics. Fang Hongjian never dared to indulge in delusions and began studying Schopenhauer. He often cleverly told his classmates, "Where in the world is love? It's just a reproductive impulse." In the blink of an eye, he was already in his fourth year of college, waiting only for graduation and marriage next year. One day, my father sent a fast letter saying, "I received a telegram from your father-in-law and was shocked to learn that Shuying was suffering from typhoid fever, which was mistakenly caused by Western medicine. Therefore, she passed away at 4 pm on the 13th of this month, which is truly regrettable. Passing through the door is just around the corner, and good things have been worn out, all of which are due to your lack of fortune." After the letter, he added a few more words: "The wise man lost his horse, but he knew that it was not a blessing. If we got married three years ago, our family will have to spend a lot of money this time. However, our family has accumulated virtue, and if the marriage is completed early, our daughter-in-law may be able to escape disaster and extend her life. The marriage is predetermined, so there is no need to be too sad. But your father-in-law should send a letter of condolence to mourn. Okay." Hongjian saw the joy of the prisoner being pardoned, but he also felt a little pity for the short-lived girl. Having enjoyed the joy of freedom, I was willing for others to alleviate their sorrow, so I sent a long letter of condolence to my father-in-law who had not yet passed through the door. Manager Zhou received the letter and felt that the child was polite, so he handed it over to Director Wang of the bank's document department for a reply. The head of the document department saw Yuan Xin and greatly praised the young master to his employer for his excellent literary, logical, and calligraphy skills, as well as his deep affection for the deceased. He believed that he had a very strong nature and must be a far sighted person. Manager Zhou was happy to hear this and asked the director to reply, saying: Although my daughter has never been married and my status as a son-in-law has not changed, I only have one daughter in my life. I wanted to have a good time, but now I will add the dowry and wedding money to my daughter's business interest, totaling 20000 yuan, which is equivalent to 1300 pounds in foreign exchange, to be used as study abroad expenses for Fang Hongjian when he graduates next year. Fang Hongjian never dreamed of such good luck and was very grateful to his deceased fianc é e. He is a useless person who cannot study civil engineering. He transferred from the sociology department to the philosophy department in university and eventually graduated from the Chinese literature department. It sounds somewhat comical for people who study Chinese to go abroad for further studies. In fact, only those who study Chinese literature must study abroad. Because all other subjects such as mathematics, physics, philosophy, psychology, economics, law, etc. were introduced from abroad and have long been infused with a strong sense of foreign influence; Only when the national language is a domestic product and requires foreign branding can it maintain its status, just as Chinese officials and merchants need to exchange the money they exploit in their own country for foreign exchange in order to maintain the original value of the national currency.
When Fang Hung chien arrived in Europe, he neither bankrolled Dunhuang papers, nor visited the Yongle Grand Ceremony, nor sought documents from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, nor learned Mongolian, Xizang or Sanskrit. I switched three universities in four years, London, Paris, and Berlin; Listening to a few subjects casually, with a wide range of interests and no experience, life is particularly lazy. In the spring of the fourth year, he saw that there were only over four hundred pounds left in the bank and planned to return home in the summer. Mr. Fang also wrote a letter asking if he had obtained his doctoral degree and when he would return home. He replied with a big argument, cursing the impracticality of the doctoral title. Mr. Fang doesn't agree, but his son is too old to threaten his father's dignity anymore; He said in the letter that he knew his title was useless and would never force his son, but Manager Zhou had paid a lot of money and finally had to give him an explanation. A few days later, Fang Hongjian received another letter from his father-in-law, saying, "A virtuous son-in-law is highly educated and wealthy, famous in all five continents, and there is no need to boast about his doctoral degree. However, Your Majesty is the former Qing Dynasty's Filial and Honest Duke, and a virtuous son-in-law seems to be able to pass the imperial examination and become a successful candidate in the imperial examination. Even if he is a commoner, he will be able to overcome difficulties and achieve success in the future." Fang Hongjian was attacked from both sides and realized the importance of obtaining a degree from studying abroad. This diploma seems to have the function of the leaf on Adam and Eve's lower body, which can cover up shame and ugliness; A small square of paper can cover up a person's emptiness, clumsiness, and foolishness. I don't have a diploma, it seems like I'm mentally naked and without a package. But now when it comes to obtaining a degree, whether it's studying on one's own or hiring a ghostwriter to do the paper, time economy is not enough. A doctoral degree from the nearby University of Hamburg is considered the easiest to obtain, but it also takes six months. Why don't you just lie to your family and say you're a doctor? I'm afraid it won't be enough to coax your father and father-in-law; My father was a successful candidate in the imperial examination, so we need to look at the "declaration". My father-in-law was a businessman, so we need to look at the contract. He couldn't come up with a solution and prepared to go home with a poker face, saying he didn't get his degree. One day, he went to the Chinese book cataloging room of the Berlin Library to visit a German friend and saw a pile of periodicals from Shanghai in the early years of the Republic of China on the floor, including "Oriental Magazine", "Fiction Monthly", "Greater China", and "Women's Magazine". I casually flipped through an advertisement in both Chinese and English, which was posted by the Correspondence Department of the Clarendon School of Law and Business in New York, USA. It said that our school has set up a correspondence course for Chinese students who aspire to study abroad but do not have the opportunity. In the future, upon graduation, we will provide a certificate equivalent to a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. The articles of association will be sent to you upon request, and the communication office is located at No. X Street, New York. Fang Hongjian's heart stirred, thinking that after more than twenty years, he didn't know if this school existed. Anyway, it wouldn't cost much to write a letter asking. The person who placed the advertisement was originally a scammer, because Chinese people didn't fall for it and quit their profession, and they would have died long ago. The apartment room he lived in is now rented to an Irishman, with Irishman irresponsibility, Irishman impatience, and Irishman poverty. It is said that the real estate of the Irish people is milk and buttocks; This is a tall and thin man like George Bernard Shaw, and the weight of those two assets needs to be discounted. At that time, he received a letter from Hung chien in the mailbox and thought that the postman had sent it to the wrong address, but the address was clearly his own. Curious, he opened it and found it inexplicable. After thinking for a long time, he jumped up happily. I quickly borrowed a typewriter from a reporter from a neighboring newspaper and typed a reply, saying that since my husband is studying at a European university, he must have a high level of knowledge and there is no need to go through correspondence procedures. As long as he sends a 10000 word thesis with a payment of 500 US dollars and passes the review, he will immediately send me his doctoral degree in philosophy. The letter can be sent to me, and there is no need to write the name of the school. Signed Patrick Mahoney and later bestowed four or five doctoral titles upon himself. Fang Hongjian saw that the letter was for ordinary use and did not have the school name engraved on it. The content of the letter was clearly a scam, so he ignored it. The Irish were in a hurry and sent another letter, saying that if the price was too expensive, they could discuss it further. I have always loved China, and those who run education are particularly unwilling to make profits. Fang Hongjian calculated that the Irish were undoubtedly playing tricks. If he bought a fake diploma to deceive others, wouldn't he also become a scammer? But remember, Fang Hongjian, who studied philosophy, sometimes lies and deceit are not unethical. Plato's "Republic" states that soldiers should deceive enemies, doctors should deceive patients, and officials should deceive the people. Like Confucius, he pretended to be sick and coaxed away Confucian sorrow. Mencius even lied and pretended to be sick to King Xiang Xuan. Father and father-in-law hope to be a PhD, but are sons in law willing to disappoint them? Buying a diploma to appease them is like spending money to donate to an official in the Qing Dynasty, or a British colonial merchant repaying tens of thousands of pounds to the imperial treasury for a knightly title. It brings glory to the family and is also a filial piety and filial piety that a virtuous husband should have. Anyway, when I look for a job in the future, I will never have this degree on my resume. If the Irish refuse, even if the price is extremely low, they won't be scammers if it's blown up. I replied to the letter saying: At most, I will pay one hundred US dollars. I will send thirty dollars first, and once I receive my diploma, I will send the remaining balance; There are still more than 30 Chinese students here who are willing to contact your school through this method. At first, the Irish didn't want to agree, but later they saw Fang Hongjian's resolute tone and found out nearby that American doctoral titles were indeed fashionable in China. They gradually believed that there were over thirty Chinese fools in Europe who wanted to buy diplomas from him. He also found out that there are many peers doing this kind of business, such as Eastern University, Eastern United States University, Intercollegiate University, Truth University, etc. The cheapest ones can buy a master's degree for ten dollars, and the College of Divine Metaphysics offers three types of doctoral degrees at a low price; These are all registered and prestigious schools, which I cannot compare to. So he adhered to the principle of selling at a low profit and made a deal with Hung chien. He received thirty dollars, printed forty to fifty blank diplomas, filled out one, and sent it to Hung chien with a letter urging him to pay and notifying other students to come and negotiate. Hung chien returned to the channel and after a detailed investigation, it was found that there was no such school in the United States, and diplomas were worthless paper. As a first-time offender, she was not pursued and hoped to repent and reform herself. She remitted ten dollars to exchange for the opportunity to change careers. The Irish were so popular that they cursed incessantly, getting drunk and red eyed that they wanted to fight Chinese people. This may be the only victory for China since its own diplomacy or treaty making.
Hung chien first went to the photo studio and put on the uniform of a German university PhD, taking a four inch photo. Father and father-in-law each sent a letter, with a thousand reminders that they hated the title of "Doctor" the most in their lives. This time, they were not exempt from tradition and were not worthy of being outsiders. I went back to France for a few weeks and bought a second-class ticket to return home. After Marseille boarded the ship, he was the only Chinese in the second-class cabin, feeling lonely and bored. The third class Chinese students felt that he was also a student and sat in the second-class cabin, showing some hostility towards him. He found out that there was an empty berth in the cabin of a third class Annamite, so he discussed with the ship's steward and voluntarily gave up the original cabin and moved down to sleep, while the food was still in second class. Among these Chinese people on the same ship, only Miss Su is an old acquaintance of China. She studied French literature in Lyon and wrote a paper titled "Eighteen Chinese Vernacular Poets", and was newly awarded a doctoral degree. When she was a college classmate, she may not have had Fang Hongjian in her eyes. At that time, Miss Su valued her love too much and refused to give it away casually. Now, it's like making good clothes, reluctant to wear them, locked in a box. In a year or two, I suddenly realize that the appearance and color of these clothes are not fashionable anymore, and I feel a little regretful. In the past, she was determined to study abroad, thinking that those who pursued her had no future prospects, and at most they were college graduates. Now, as a female PhD, she feels a sense of noble loneliness that no one dares to climb up. She had some knowledge of Hung chien's family background, and seeing that he didn't dislike him and seemed to have enough money, she was quite interested in using this voyage to give him a chance to get closer. Miss Bao, who was in the same cabin as her, went ahead without warning. Miss Bao grew up in Macau and is said to have Portuguese blood in her body. The phrase 'Portuguese blood' is equivalent to the Japanese claiming to have their own culture, or the author of a privately adapted foreign script declaring that their revised version 'has copyright and cannot be translated'. Because the Portuguese have Chinese elements mixed in their blood. Based on Miss Bao's physique, it is estimated that her Portuguese mother may have indirectly inherited Arab blood from Spain. Miss Bao had a slender waist, which perfectly matched the beauty conditions praised by Arab poets in "The Arabian Nights": "She was thin in circumference, heavy at the back, and her waist and limbs were sore when standing." She had a pair of sleepy, smiling, and dreamy big eyes on her long eyelashes, and her perfect upper lips seemed to be bulging and teasing her lover. Her fianc é, Dr. Li, didn't care and paid for her to go to London alone to study obstetrics. There is a Portuguese proverb that says, "Those who are lucky will have a daughter as their first child." Because when a girl grows up, she can do odd jobs and take care of her younger siblings. Before she gets married, her parents can save the wages of a maid. Miss Bao has been used to being called by her parents since childhood. She is clever and understands that opportunities need to be found by herself, and happiness needs to be found by herself. So she would rather get engaged to someone twelve years older than herself and have the opportunity to go abroad. British people are used to seeing fair skin, and when they see her dark but not black color and her greasy and spicy attraction, they think she is a true Eastern beauty. She is confident in her ability to seduce people, so she seduced them quickly and easily. Fortunately, she is studying medicine and doesn't take it seriously, and there hasn't been any trouble. She spent two years in the UK, and this time she went back to get married and went public with her husband. After boarding the ship, Chinese students found out that she was holding a "British citizen" passport issued by the Hong Kong government, which did not count as Chinese nationality and did not get close to her. She doesn't speak French and disdains having local conversations with third class Guangdong waiters, feeling bored. She saw Fang Hongjian as a second-class person who was decent and could be a companion for leisure during travel. Miss Su's ideal self is "as beautiful as peaches and plums, as cold as frost", which makes Fang Hongjian admire her humbly and then bow down to pursue her. Who knew that although the climate was around 100 degrees Fahrenheit every day, this sweet and cold ice cream style wouldn't work. Miss Bao easily hooked Fang Hongjian with just one sentence. Hung chien moved to third class tomorrow and went for a walk on the deck. He accidentally ran into Miss Bao, who was leaning against the railing of the ship in the breeze, and started chatting with her. Without saying a few words, Miss Bao smiled and said, "Mr. Fang, you reminded me of my fiance. You look just like him!" Upon hearing this, Fang Hongjian felt both shy and proud. A lovely woman saying that you look like her fianc é means that if she were not engaged, you would be entitled to her love. The sarcastic ghost may explain it this way: she already has a fianc é, and you can enjoy her fianc é's rights without fulfilling the obligation to marry her. Anyway, their friendship grew rapidly like a tropical plant from then on. Other Chinese male students joked with Fang Hongjian and forced him to treat everyone to iced coffee and beer.
At that time, although Fang Hongjian blamed Miss Bao for her unruly behavior, he also felt excited. Looking back, I saw Miss Su and Mrs. Sun with two empty chairs. Fortunately, the cigarette incident just now fell into their eyes. That evening, there was a sea breeze and the boat was a bit bumpy. After ten o'clock, there were only three or five pairs of men and women on the deck, all hiding in the dark shadows that could not be illuminated by the lights, whispering sweet words. Fang Hongjian and Miss Bao walked side by side without saying a word. A big wave shook the hull of the ship, and Miss Bao couldn't stand steadily. Fang Hongjian hooked her waist and leaned against the railing, kissing her greedily. Miss Bao's lips hinted, her body obediently, and this hurried and rough kiss gradually stabilized, growing perfectly close. Miss Bao deftly pushed away Fang Hongjian's arm, took a deep breath, and said, "I'm suffocating you! I'm catching a cold and can't breathe in my nose - it's too cheap for you, you haven't begged me to love you yet.
